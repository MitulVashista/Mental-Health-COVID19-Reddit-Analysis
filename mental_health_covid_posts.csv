depression,1jmfhrc,2025-03-29 11:05:49,"Hi! 

For the amount of trauma, heartbreak, uncertainty and emotional pain many of us endured during the ""COVID years,"" it seems like everyone just moved on post-Covid. The world and people went from talking/hearing about COVID 24/7 to just nothing. It went silent overnight. Covid took so much from me, as it did from many others. I won't get into the details but I experienced much loss, lots of change some more loss and some of the most haunting feelings of loneliness and sadness that I have ever experienced in my life!!! During the winter months (when it was too cold to go outside), and during the COVID lockdowns, I lived on my couch and never left my home for over a year.  I feel so lost, empty, unmotivated and just blasé. I feel like I lost out on so much during those years. In addition,  my sleep schedule, my hygiene and organizing/house cleaning skills are still screwed up POST-COVID. I was extremely isolated and completely alone, kept on alert, anxious and scared during that time period and it changed me....it sent me into a very deep and dark depression. I write this to inquire about others who have been changed severely from the ""Covid years"" and just want a place to chat about whats in their hearts and on their minds with others who can relate and won't judge :) ",hi amount trauma heartbreak uncertainty emotional pain many us endured covid years seems like everyone moved world people went covid nothing went silent overnight covid took much many others wo get details experienced much loss lots change loss haunting feelings loneliness sadness ever experienced life winter months cold go outside covid lockdowns lived couch never left home year feel lost empty unmotivated blasé feel like lost much years addition sleep schedule hygiene cleaning skills still screwed extremely isolated completely alone kept alert anxious scared time period changed sent deep dark depression write inquire others changed severely covid years want place chat whats hearts minds others relate wo judge
depression,1hohep2,2024-12-29 04:13:55,"Ever since I got covid 3 years ago my life has been a living hell. Covid has given me EXTREME brain fog/dissociation. I have lost all of my intelligence and living no longer has any meaning to me

I have so many things I want to do but I don't feel any pleasure anymore so I have no motivation to do anything. I can no longer feel my body, and I am ""zoned out"" 24/7. I literally went from being a carefree kid that was happy most of the time to this shell of a human being. It's been more than  3 years, im 20 now, and it hasn't gotten even 0.01% better. I have lost all hope of recovering over time

The only thing that helps me are compression socks, but even that causes me to only go from 5% to 15%. I would consider myself a very disciplined person but willpower is not enough to make me want to do anything without any pleasure or reward. I don't even watch shows or read anymore. I used to pass every subject in school with ease, now I have almost failed 3 courses despite the content being way easier than highschool.

I don't have any mental illness but it doesn't matter. No matter what I think or do the brainfog remains. I used to love playing competitive video games, and I would get to the top 0.1% in every game I played. My dream was to become a professional player, and I was genuinely close. Now I can't even get past the top 40% no matter how much effort I put in. I'm giving myself 2, maybe 2 and a half years. If I can't fix my problems by then, I'm jumping off a bridge. I can't live like this any longer than that and I no longer care. I refuse to live a life devoid of any pleasure or joy.

depression,sey6g5,2022-01-29 00:39:26,"I don’t know what to do anymore. I just found out on Monday that my boyfriend, the love of my life, passed away from covid. I can’t live with out him. He took care of me. He was always there for me. He was the whole reason I got up in the morning. The whole reason im even still alive. But now he’s gone. And I miss him so much. I just wanna hear his voice again. We never even met in person, but we were so in love. We were gonna meet. We were gonna get married. We were gonna spend our lives together. We planned out our whole future together. We were supposed to be together forever. We were perfect for each other. We were soulmates. Im a huge mess, and I just want to die. I was finally happy. And it’s just been ripped away from me. It feels like I was never meant to be happy. I was sexually and emotionally abused for a huge part of my childhood. But my boyfriend helped me. He saved me. He helped me report and get away from my abuser. He supported me and cared for me and was always there for me. He was so loving and caring. Fuck I miss him so bad. Ive been crying ever since I found out. And it just gets worse as the days go on. I wake up more depressed every day. More hopeless and devastated. I have no will to live anymore. He was my everything. My whole world. I’m so lost without him. I just talked to him last week. He died so suddenly. He had covid. But he promised he’d be okay. He promised. But then he just stopped responding. And I messaged one of his friends and that was it. They found him dead in his apartment. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. The last time we talked, I was just crying because I was so worried about him and all he kept saying was how much he loved me. And then I accidentally fell asleep and we got off call and he died later that day. I just don’t know what to do. I just want to hear his voice. His laugh. See his smile. The way he’d look at me. His silly jokes. He’s gone. I’m never gonna see him again. We’re never gonna get to do All the things we were supposed to do together, all the things we talked about and dreamed about. We’ll never do it. And I can’t deal with it. My therapist sent me to the ER on Tuesday because I had a huge meltdown when talking to her. And when I got there, I tested positive for covid. They can’t send me to a psychiatric hospital because I’m covid positive and I’m only sixteen so I can’t stay at the one in the hospital. I’m gonna be stuck here for days. I’m too high risk for suicide to send home. My life fucking sucks. I’m just rotting away in this hospital bed. All I want to do is hurt myself and die. I’m miserable. I’ve never felt this much pain in my entire life. I can’t stop crying. I miss him so bad. I love him so much. I love him more than anything and he’s gone. I can’t live without him. I’m done with life. I’ve had so much pain. All the abuse I’ve went through, and now this. he was the one thing that made things better. He made me so happy. Happier then I’d ever been in my entire life. He was the only one who understood me. The only one who was there for me during some of my abuse. But he’s fucking dead. I can’t stop thinking about him. Everything reminds me of him. Im already starting to forget his voice. I’m just done. I’m done trying. I’ve completely given up. Everyone has been saying it’ll get better. But I’ve heard that for almost seven years, and it just seems to get worse. I’m probably going to kill myself once I get out of the hospital. I already have a few ideas as to how. I’ve lost apart of myself. I lost the most important person in my life. The person I love the most. This feels like a bad dream. I wish I could wake up and he was still here. It hurts so bad. I’m so sad and miserable. So empty without him. I wish I could just sleep forever. I’ve always been depressed. I’ve always been fucked up. But he gave me hope. He loved me despite all my problems. He took care of me. I can’t take care of myself. Everyone keeps saying I have this sad look in my eyes, this weird face. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same. I just don’t know what to say anymore, what to do. My seventeenth birthday is in a two weeks, and I’m probably going to be spending it in the psych ward. I love you more than anything in the whole world, James. I love you so much. I never thought I’d lose you. It’s really hard. God it’s so hard. But it only hurts so much because I love you so much.  I really wish you could have held me in your arms just once. I can’t stop thinking about the fact that you died all by yourself. I should of been there next to you. You shouldn’t have died at all. I miss you more than anything. I’ve never felt a pain like this. I was so lucky to have known you. To have lived in the same world as someone as amazing and perfect as you. You’ve always been a piece of my heart but now that’s all you are. I’m never going to get over you. We’ve been through so much together. We were meant to be together. We deserved to be happy together.  Life is so cruel and unfair. I love you more than I could ever express with mere words. You were a part of me. We were like two pieces of a whole. And now your piece is missing. I’m so lost and scared and confused. I can’t imagine a life without you in it. I try to think of the future and it’s just blank. The pages of our future storybook were torn out. You are my everything, my whole world. The love of my life and my soulmate. I am absolutely devastated. My heart is in excruciating pain. It longs for you, and it can’t have you. It hurts so bad. I miss you more than anything. I wish I could just hear your voice one last time, your laugh, your silly jokes, and little kisses. I miss your rambling about all the interesting things you know and like. I miss your face and your little tuffs of hair that would stick up against your headphones. I miss the way you’d smile. I miss the way you’d always cheer me up when I was sad. I miss all your little love poems and sappy love that just seemed to leak out of you. I miss your reassurance and your comfort. I miss the way you loved me and cared about me like no other. I love everything about you, and I miss everything about you. I’ll be seeing you soon as soon as I can. I can’t wait to hold you, to kiss you, to be with you. I love you so much, forever and always.

I was diagnosed with depression and even almost 5 years later, I still have relapse. I am now far behind my peers. Everyone is working an earning money now while I am still depending on my parents cuz I have to pursue post graduate degree because my degree is useless without masters or PhD. You might think that I am doing well or I’m getting back my spark in life and academics just because I go to graduate school, but no. I am not my best self and I still feel shit. I somehow feel that my parents are pressuring me to finish up my studies so they can already retire, although they don’t say it to me directly. I still regret not graduating with latin honors because thats how Asian families measure your worth. I feel worthless.

depression,gx4ic5,2020-06-05 18:54:45,"Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",jesus even start could read title black man always fight grew racism forms country ironically usually denies ever racism way kind shit heard entire life molded someone sense voice made introvert mentality need work twice hard everyone always saw future bleak tiresome struggle never really changed got worse time college awful reality came afterwards depressed life initial diagnosis age still severe anxiety first suicidal thoughts came age 8 already hated everything enough world wanted failing best never getting anything good life never letting rest human recent events like absurd police brutality worldwide rise authoritarianism country worked bone around clock due pandemic country quickly moving worst afflicted mom danger times living neighbourhood near place white supremacist parade happened also happens place lot people simply disrespecting quarantine shit wearing really badly wake exhausted ca deal anything without serious bout anxiety anger outbursts followed fullscale breakdowns feeling guilty worrying friends mom feel guilty feeling tired feeling afraid feel guilty feeling brave enough go streets people taking action feel guilty existing fucking exhausted know want end wan na go somewhere else ca handle anything anymore edit support thankful think never felt supported whole life words touched deeply glad helped feel hopeful energized talking thank thank bottom heart stopped something terrible today thank edit 2 wow expecting kind response many people trying respond everyone think ca like thank words glad vented feelings feel much support feel like feelings valid worth feeling may seem bit dramatic legitimately walking different outlook life never expected see many people know rush support absolute worst thank mean love
depression,1fp71hj,2024-09-25 20:49:46,"3 months ago, almost all of a sudden, I started to have difficulty breathing, that was the beginning of hell.

While my breathing seems like it's getting better as time goes on, the mental aspect is crushing. My head is heavy everyday, I feel like I'm going to go insane and I have debilitating mental fog and fatigue. My symptoms are so heavy that I have to pause college for the rest of the school year. And guess what? There's currently no treatment for long Covid, which means I might eventually get better, after months, to years of struggle, ruining all that I've worked toward, or it just very well might never get better.

I had a good life, I was on a path, people kept saying I was going to achieve great things in life, and then, all of a sudden, my body and mind have been stolen from me. I can't even keep my head physically straight to play video games, read a book, nothing.

I pray to God that I get better, and if I do, you can be sure that I'll exercise like hell, do marathons, go to the gym, hike like I used to, and most importantly, help others with long Covid.

But if I don't get better...   what's the point in living? I mean really? Just to hope? Even if it eventually gets better, will it be worth the years of suffering? My life basically stopped at the age of 22. To me, I basically died July 1st, 2024. The rest has been nothing but pain, grief, helplessness, anxiety, panic, depression.

So, to quote the great Frank Sinatra:

""But if there's nothing shaking, come this here July  
I'm gonna roll myself up  
In a big ball and die""

  
What would be the point in going on?",3 months ago almost sudden started difficulty breathing beginning hell breathing seems like getting better time goes mental aspect crushing head heavy everyday feel like going go insane debilitating mental fog fatigue symptoms heavy pause college rest school year guess currently treatment long covid means might eventually get better months years struggle ruining worked toward well might never get better good life path people kept saying going achieve great things life sudden body mind stolen ca even keep head physically straight play video games read book nothing pray god get better sure exercise like hell marathons go gym hike like used importantly help others long covid get better point living mean really hope even eventually gets better worth years suffering life basically stopped age basically died july 1st rest nothing pain grief helplessness anxiety panic depression quote great frank sinatra nothing shaking come july gon na roll big ball die would point going

I can go on holidays every year, hell I even bought a my sister a brand new iPhone with my own hard-earned money. Social life was great too. Like I never had to worry about present things because everything good was going my way.

2020 is where things goes downhill. Lost my job due to covid. I barely have any money. Business was severely affected because people stopped buying shit. I also had to spend a fortune on health care, PCR tests, and equipments which were so expensive because people can't stop hoarding supplies.

In 2021, although not as bad, is still nowhere as good as pre-2020. I can travel again, but some of my friends started departing away from my life, as they started working or spending most of their time with their partners.

In 2022, russia declares war on ukraine which ridiculously increased gas prices, which affects other prices as well, like my bills. Also I felt like it was one of the lowest point in my life.

In 2023, tech winters struck and people got laid off, me included, because companies would rather use ChatGPT for free instead of hiring people. I lost my job and had to live without income for several months. Business is getting harder too. People are cutting every corners they can.

In 2024, political tension is getting worse, we see wars everywhere, although not a major one, it's only a matter of time. The job market is also getting worse by the day.

Life is just not the same after covid. It just feels it's getting worse, at least for me. I hope things will turn out good this year, but I have no expectations.

depression,1amknz6,2024-02-09 15:21:46,"When covid came around and everyone had to quarantine I slowly started to spiral, without even realizing it.

I don't remember anything too clearly from those times but at some point i cut off the only friend i had. Its been about three years since then and i haven't made any new friends or really tried to make any. i dropped out of my junior year of high school last year and haven't done anything since. no work, no school, no hobbies, passions. just isolation pretty much. apparently the Japanese have a word for it, ""hikikomori,"" something like that if I'm remembering correctly. And for the first time in these three of four years I'm kind of trying to improve. i don't give in to my exhaustion and try to push through and make goals, even if there small. i haven't cut or starved myself in a few months but sometimes i wanna go back, and give in, and lay in a dark room and sleep and stop thinking. lots of people say that that's just how being 17 is, and you'll get through it and the world will keep spinning and life will keep moving and you'll find a way and figure it out but after 4 years I'm losing hope. i want to believe that but idk what to do, or what i want, and I'm getting tired.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries.

depression,kv7p2d,2021-01-11 23:13:54,"I've been depressed for 18 years. The worst years of it have mostly passed, not getting out of bed, force-feeding myself through tears, late everywhere everyday for no better reason than the factual ""nothing really matters, does it"". Losing friends left and right due to just not being fun and peppy enough, even for those who aren't fun or peppy themselves. The way this world is run, demanding perfection and being unforgiving of anything less, it's enough for any sane person to break. But ok, whatever, right? My bad and all.

So after about a dozen therapists, medication, outdoor activities, eating well, and the corrosion inside has never gone away, I guess a few years ago I simply accepted that I am this way and no one will ever care or feel sympathy because they have their own problems and gosh darn it they just want to believe the world is damn near perfect, it's just the individual's failure to acknowledge it, right?

As such, some of you may be familiar with that meme/joke: ""I don't struggle with depression. By this time I have basically mastered depression"". That's how I am. A high functioning depressed person. I go to work (at an animal hospital), I even go on time or early, I eat healthy, I go for walks, I'm friendly, to everyone (even people who are hostile and mean, it's just easier for me to ignore them and if I can't then I kill them with kindness until they fuck off), every day I'm faced with comments from my coworkers, ""you're so energetic!"", ""Thank you for being so devoted all day every day"", ""how do you stay so chipper?"" Because every client who comes through I mean it when I ask them how they are, and when they answer honestly that they aren't doing well I will chat with them for twenty minutes until they feel they've been heard and can end the conversation feeling just a little bit lighter, I wish them a merry Christmas/happy new year, please take care of yourself, we'll see you again soon, all with a big smile while my inner-frown sits on the back burner. It takes a fuckton of strength I don't even understand where it comes from. I don't understand how I can have the strength to appear non-depressed while still feeling that way inside. It goes against everything that every therapist has ever promised me. Fake it til you make it has proven to be utterly fruitless. But I continue to fake it, ""for the kids"" (and by kids I mean the adults who desperately cling to any innocence and optimism they can through it all. In a sense I can't blame them, but it delays any valuable change from happening for the rest of the suffering populace, which is a whole other can of worms, not what this post is about).

Even before covid, I've really disliked the stigma surrounding missing work due to illness. Even bringing a doctor's note gets you the stink eye from coworkers. You just know that when you call or text in that you're unwell, even though you're not physically there you can hear everyone groan ""ohhh deaaar what do they have?"" Dripping with sarcasm and disdain, as you've witnessed being done while you're at work and anyone else calls in sick. It's disgusting, and honestly I've always made a point to just show compassion to anyone who phones to cancel an appointment because they're not feeling well, even if they do it every week, even if they're ""faking"". Something is clearly going on with them that they feel they can't handle whatever it is they're canceling for the day. What is me getting upset about it going to fix? Look to the managers who always understaff everyone, perhaps? No, it must be the fakers!

Anyway, I was hunched over my desk just trying to focus on my breathing and not cry. My depression has always manifested itself into physical ailments.  By now I've gone to get tested for covid twice, both times came back negative. Today is a day where I just know it's not covid (not that that's a valid reason not to get tested). On that note, I'm annoyed by the criteria of covid symptoms because if you check anything on that list a big red box pops up ""go get tested immediately"". It's positively intimidating and I know what's going on. I know I'm ""just"" depressed.

depression,jz3rhk,2020-11-23 02:49:02,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",update sorry advance mobile long really expecting amount support kindness many people thank uplifting words thank rewards like first address concerns meeting pandemic friend made plans meet coffee shop buy quick cup coffee immediately head park nearby separate cars coffee shop small military base cuts amount people lot went ahead grabbed coffee waited bench outside shop around 30 minutes leaving stayed 6 feet away others wore mask entire time played safe went rules next like say thank helped realize big accomplishment get coffee shop really take lot effort appreciate reminder took strength know also want thank expressed empathy towards friend going rough time since long pandemic started angry understand struggling really sad disappointed seen since last year bummer anything needed somewhere get chest came reddit kind people reddit disappoint going continue friend dear knowing kind person probably truly forgot potential miscommunication may something come get would nice get bit heads explanation dwelled much reach ready understand therapy medication since 2018 recently sent cease amp desist letter went contact mother result heard dad since happened also live states away childhood friends left family supports many people better toxic environment still grief process losing people still alive also grieving could healthy supportive parents also struggling marriage military spouse hard far away little support states away sisters go detail rocky marriage traumatic hard gotten much support therapy support younger sisters capable giving process filling divorce papers working attorneys office explore options also surgery end october repair hernia big deal sisters came town visit recovery knock bit emotionally restricted carrying anything 20 pounds meant hold toddler 30 pounds really hard us would nice able hung talked one friend everything going honestly would nice talk things nothing crap gone year okay though life carry better days still got coffee got outside came home hung son put christmas decorations also got ton fantastic advise support lovely folks thank tl dr thank support kind words mad friend sad meet followed social distancing rules going 2020 sucked personally past decade

depression,kgmy1e,2020-12-20 09:16:54,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

depression,hzah5n,2020-07-28 13:17:02,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",posting subs know feel like reached breaking point im tired tired existing tired

Guys I need some advice. 

2 years ago I started having insomnia, aniety, depression, fatigue, brain fog, hair loss, hot flashes, short breath, depersonalisation, tinnitus, GI issues, heart racing etc..

At that time my GP brought a burnout on the table. I spent then a year in psychiatrists and tried 6 antidepressants (Lexapro, Effexor, vortioxetine, trazodone, Prozac, Prozac +Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin alone)

All those helped somehow with sleep and anxiety but none of them resolved my fatigue and my brain fog !

So my GP brought long COVID on the table as I catched it before that ""burnout"" and never had anxiety issues before it. 

So now I am free of antidepressants for 5 months but I find myself really numb or sad from times to times, like my life hasn't a purpose or a meaning. Which I had before, I love my job, friends etc...

It's well documented now that long COVID can induce depression. But I am wondering if there is a way to truly know ? Indeed, I am afraid that I am really depressed and that not taking medicine will let it become chronic... I just want my old self back..

Any advice please ?",guys need advice 2 years ago started insomnia aniety depression fatigue brain fog hair loss hot flashes short breath depersonalisation tinnitus gi issues heart racing etc time gp brought burnout table spent year psychiatrists tried 6 antidepressants lexapro effexor vortioxetine trazodone prozac prozac wellbutrin alone helped somehow sleep anxiety none resolved fatigue brain fog gp brought long covid table catched burnout never anxiety issues free antidepressants 5 months find really numb sad times times like life purpose meaning love job friends etc well documented long covid induce depression wondering way truly know indeed afraid really depressed taking medicine let become chronic want old self back advice please
depression,111eade,2023-02-13 22:39:48,"2023 has been pretty bleak so far. Yet, hope still lingers.

When my insurance changed on January 1st, one of my more crucial medications was no longer covered. Even after the pharmacist added a coupon, 30 pills cost $600.00. (Obviously I live in the United States.) It wasn't until after a week of withdrawal that I thought to look up if there was a savings program offered by the manufacturer. ALWAYS look at the manufacturer's website to see if they can make the medication you need affordable. I finally managed to sign up for the savings program, give the info to my pharmacy, and obtain the medication! Tonight, I take my first dose back towards sanity.

A week ago today, I got sick. Tested positive for COVID and have since run the gambit of symptoms. Weirdly enough, this past week has been one of my better weeks in the past year or so. My number one depression coping mechanism of late has been a nocturnal and excessive sleep schedule. Getting COVID meant that, not only was I expected to sleep all day, I was supposed to. This past week, I haven't had to put energy into my physical appearance or into pretending I'm doing okay. The ever-present sadness of deteriorating interpersonal relationships disappeared, replaced by fevers and coughing fits. No more guilt around feeling useless. COVID gave me purpose. Suddenly the steps I should take to improve my life were as simple as ""drink water."" I got over the worst of the sickness yesterday. To my dismay, the booming voice of depression began again in my head. The tumult of fear and grief came rushing back. Part of me longs for the all-consuming fevers and body aches to return. Much rather physical anguish than the cage of depression.

As much as it pains the depression in my head to hear, however, things are looking up. The loose trash on my floor has morphed into a collection of plump trash bags. I'm beginning to spend more daylight hours awake. I have full bottles of all my medications. I'm hydrated. Once my prescribed isolation is over, I might even... Cook? Vacuum? Go for a walk? I know the depression, which has followed me since I could first form memories, will always be there. Yet, just as I know the despair is inevitable, I can rely on the fact that there will be moments in between. Not necessarily joyful, or even happy, moments. But moments which make this life worth living.",2023 pretty bleak far yet hope still lingers insurance changed january 1st one crucial medications longer covered even pharmacist added coupon 30 pills cost obviously live united states week withdrawal thought look savings program offered manufacturer always look manufacturer website see make medication need affordable finally managed sign savings program give info pharmacy obtain medication tonight take first dose back towards sanity week ago today got sick tested positive covid since run gambit symptoms weirdly enough past week one better weeks past year number one depression coping mechanism late nocturnal excessive sleep schedule getting covid meant expected sleep day supposed past week put energy physical appearance pretending okay sadness deteriorating interpersonal relationships disappeared replaced fevers coughing fits guilt around feeling useless covid gave purpose suddenly steps take improve life simple drink water got worst sickness yesterday dismay booming voice depression began head tumult fear grief came rushing back part longs fevers body aches return much rather physical anguish cage depression much pains depression head hear however things looking loose trash floor morphed collection plump trash bags beginning spend daylight hours awake full bottles medications hydrated prescribed isolation might even cook vacuum go walk know depression followed since could first form memories always yet know despair inevitable rely fact moments necessarily joyful even happy moments moments make life worth living

depression,10rch8o,2023-02-02 06:48:07,"*This kinda turned into a general rant about my situation, so sorry about the length*

I’m still not over the effects of COVID and I find it weird that no one talks about it anymore. Are the normal people over it already? I struggled with depression long before COVID, but just before it hit, I had finally built up good habits (I even flossed every day!), I was working on my social skills, I was keeping up with my academics, and looking into trying to date for the first time. Then COVID came out of nowhere and fucked that all up, trapping me in a house with the family members I couldn’t stand and ruining my progress in maintaining routines and overcoming my social anxiety. I still tried to make the most of the time saved commuting by exercising, doing yoga, journaling, engaging in hobbies, etc. and then my mom died and I haven’t been able to mentally recover since. 

I was still a teen when COVID started and now I still feel like one, and I feel even more out of place socially than I did before. I’ve also reverted in my self-care and academic habits, and I’ve unable to build them back up for long despite numerous attempts. It was a lot easier to keep routines based on cues from having to leave home to go to school, but I’ve gotten so used to being able to not leave my home that I now avoid it at all costs, because I can’t decide whether the social isolation or the anxiety from real social interaction is worse for my mental health. I also have no choice but online school and I was so shit at the one in-person job I’ve worked at since due to my social anxiety that I’m afraid to try it again. So my finances are also shit and another recession is coming as if COVID didn’t fuck the economy and society up badly enough. 

So now I’m a young adult, and I’m supposed to graduate and act like a grown adult soon, but my social skills, job experience, mental and physical health, and general ability to take care of myself are all so poor. I have essentially no high school or college experience socially (including romantic/sexual experience, making friends, partying, etc.) and I feel overwhelmed by the task of trying to catch up to other people my age, who seem to have it all together. I’m always the least organized group member and the last student to find a group in my classes and I feel so bad for affecting other people with my delinquency. I don’t even have hope that I can get better again, because I’ve tried and failed so many times over the last couple years and I just keep getting worse. The 5 antidepressants I’ve tried and even stimulants for my ADHD haven’t helped. I don’t know what to do anymore.",kinda turned general rant situation sorry length still effects covid find weird one talks anymore normal people already struggled depression long covid hit finally built good habits even flossed every day working social skills keeping academics looking trying date first time covid came nowhere fucked trapping house family members stand ruining progress maintaining routines overcoming social anxiety still tried make time saved commuting exercising yoga journaling engaging hobbies etc mom died able mentally recover since still teen covid started still feel like one feel even place socially also reverted academic habits unable build back long despite numerous attempts lot easier keep routines based cues leave home go school gotten used able leave home avoid costs decide whether social isolation anxiety real social interaction worse mental health also choice online school shit one job worked since due social anxiety afraid try finances also shit another recession coming covid fuck economy society badly enough young adult supposed graduate act like grown adult soon social skills job experience mental physical health general ability take care poor essentially high school college experience socially including experience making friends partying etc feel overwhelmed task trying catch people age seem together always least organized group member last student find group classes feel bad affecting people delinquency even hope get better tried failed many times last couple years keep getting worse 5 antidepressants tried even stimulants adhd helped know anymore

The thing is, she was always sick, she had Lupus which is a chronic disease that affects your joints, brain, and kidneys, and I have never seen her healthy in my entire life, and she also had depression.

And 1 day before she died, I told my therapist that I hated her, because she brought me to this life and I blamed her for my misery, my point was (why did she gave birth to me when she suffered from such a chronic illness?) and I could never appreciate life, and for that I can't forgive her.

The next day my brother called me and told me that she died.

And now it's been 3 days and I hate myself sooo freakin much for having these thoughts just before she died, I feel like I am the worst person ever, and I don't deserve to be alive.

In her dying breath she told my brother to take care of me, even though we are both adults, and when I learned about that it made me feel even worse.

Like ok I know she was not the perfect mom, but there are none to begin with, I just wish that I could talk with her, kiss and hug her one last time.

It hurts so fuckin much, my last memory of her should not be me blaming her for my situations. I feel like I'm gonna vomit just thinking about this.

depression,k55hsy,2020-12-02 13:57:42,"**EDIT:** I'm so sorry guys. I spent an hour responding to more comments, only to have to delete them because I was mistakenly posting from my main account.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

depression,l1hote,2021-01-21 01:55:37,"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now.

depression,w922ld,2022-07-27 07:37:07,"I just tested positive for covid, I was vaxxed and boosted, wore my mask, really only started coming out of the house until recently. I feel fine, don't really have any symptoms but I got a little sinus congestion today. I was gonna go on vacation to Canada so I figured it would be good to take a test just to be sure.

People say that when you get covid you take brain damage. The idea of living with permanent brain damage leaves me with a fear that I'll never be able to live a fulfilling life. I work in marketing and I can hardly imagine myself being intelligent enough to perform my job's duties let alone advance in my career with my brain barely functioning. There were so many things I wanted to do, learn a language, write a book, learn to make music, all of these are things that require intelligence to do. The joy of reading will be sapped away, my ability to play video games will fade. I don't know what I'll be able to do with myself, I don't know what unintelligent people do with their lives, how they fulfill themselves.

Even worse, I don't want to leave my wife to have to care for me. When I was a kid, I watched my dad die of MS, I saw my mom have to care for him as he succumbed to mental deterioration. She had to feed him, help him into a wheelchair, whip his ass. Now I might have to live like that and even if it doesn't get that bad I'm worried I might not be literate. She might need to help me with every instruction, everything I sign.

I've always feared getting brain damage since I was a kid and now that I know that it's coming I'm not sure what to do. I want to quit my job and just lay down and rot, there's nothing left I have to offer this world.

depression,xhwfqt,2022-09-19 05:41:51,"I have suffered with Long covid for 20 months now ( Chronic fatigue, Slight asthma induced from it, depression etc). I also have had panic attacks and anxiety from I was 7 (29 now, the anxiety turned to depression when I was around 16). 

I have been making slow but steady progress in overcoming my depression. I made a post a few months back about showering for the first time in years. I have worked hard to try and keep this up ( I have slipped a few times but I have managed to recover!). 

From beginning regular hygiene again, I began going to the gym. I am morbidly obese ( I always have been over weight/obese, I dont know what its like to not carry weight). I loved the gym, I wanted to go daily, but settled for 3 days, the Covid fatigue worsened so I backed off to 2 days a week with a 3/4 day break between workouts. This worked for around 2 months then the chronic fatigue came back and slapped me in the face leaving me unable to leave my bed for days/weeks at a time. Naturally this took a tole on my mental health again with the worry of regaining the weight, losing gym progress and strength etc. 

I told myself ""If I stay at my current weight, it will be a win"", and with that, I slowed down on the counting calories with the longer I was in bed, and began just eating when I am hungry and Stopping when I am full. 

I feel the fatigue slowly lifting from me now, I am able to drive again and go to the store on the terms that I get 1-2 days to rest after it. I still am not ready for the gym again. I decided to weigh myself today to bite the bullet (this past 2 weeks I have been eating worse food, still stopping before being extremley full and only eating when hungry). When the chronic fatigue came back I was 335lb (Starting weight at the very beginning was 362). In today's weigh in I am 333lbs. I am absolutely ecstatic with this! It has really brightened my day, and has truly encouraged me to begin cooking again! 

With this new-found joy, I decided to up 1 and do a deep clean! Mind you, it was only of the kitchen and living room, but its a start! Basically dyson'd the 2 rooms, filled the dishwasher (This is something both myself and my parents keep under control anyway), and cracked the seal on the new mop I recently bought!

depression,rv1mzh,2022-01-03 18:53:59,"I'm turning 27 this year. I have been living abroad for 6 years. I haven't been home for the last 4 years

Not to write my entire life story, but just focusing on what has happened since Covid. Before the end of 2019 my partner and I found out we were expecting a baby, my parents made plans to fly out when the baby was due and to stay for a month or two. 2020 quickly complicated things, all the plans of family coming over were quickly cancelled. It was really sad, I hadn't seen my parents/family in a couple years. That has obviously just increased over Covid now not allowing us to travel back to my home country with the new family.

End of December my grandmother passed away, I was already scared of having to lose a family member during a period where going home was out of my control. A month later, the first couple of days of 2021 my other grandmother passed away. Them not being able to meet their great-grandchild hit me very hard.

I got through 2021, but having to raise a child without the help of family made it difficult, not undoable, but it did take a toll, especially considering the current situation. The continuation of plans being made to meet up with family and then ending up being cancelled over and over again drained all the hope i had over time.

At the beginning of December I had a family member commit suicide in a very dramatic way, not to go into too much detail, it was my mothers second husband, who was abusive, I grew up in fear of what he would do, my mother had left him a couple years ago, but he was part of my entire childhood so I can't say he wasn't part of my family, and to be honest December was rough, all the trauma that I had pushed deep down into my mind resurfaced, I was reliving the fear of what he could have done toy mother, and that it could have been my mother that he killed last month.

I had a car accident the day after I heard the news, I don't have any debt, I've always made sure to keep that pressure off of myself considering I already suffer from a lot of anxiety and currently would self diagnosis myself as deep in depression. I do see a see a psychiatrist here but there is a language barrier and all that I get out of the sessions is medication which I have been on since I left university (dropout)

But to get back to what I was saying, we had cut the insurance a couple of months ago to try save some more money, the car accident was my fault, and have had to pay the bills for the damage which has hit my pockets hard and have worked out a deal to pay it off over the next 3 years.

To add some more extra details; I had started studying again, online and graduated at the end of 2020, and my partner had only started working again at the end of 2021 in order to take care of our child. So at some point I had a newborn baby, was studying part time and was the only provider for the family usually working extra jobs on the weekends.

I had hoped that writing this would help me process everything as I didn't have any real professional help regards to working through what I was going through.",turning 27 year living abroad 6 years home last 4 years write entire life story focusing happened since covid end 2019 partner found expecting baby parents made plans fly baby due stay month two 2020 quickly complicated things plans family coming quickly cancelled really sad seen couple years obviously increased covid allowing us travel back home country new family end december grandmother passed away already scared lose family member period going home control month later first couple days 2021 grandmother passed away able meet hit hard got 2021 raise child without help family made difficult undoable take toll especially considering current situation continuation plans made meet family ending cancelled drained hope time beginning december family member commit suicide dramatic way go much detail mothers second husband abusive grew fear would mother left couple years ago part entire childhood ca say part family honest december rough trauma pushed deep mind resurfaced reliving fear could done toy mother could mother killed last month car accident day heard news debt always made sure keep pressure considering already suffer lot anxiety currently would self diagnosis deep depression see see psychiatrist language barrier get sessions medication since left university dropout get back saying cut insurance couple months ago try save money car accident fault pay bills damage hit pockets hard worked deal pay next 3 years add extra details started studying online graduated end 2020 partner started working end 2021 order take care child point newborn baby studying part time provider family usually working extra jobs weekends hoped writing would help process everything real professional help regards working going

When I was 19, I was bright-eyed and naive. I thought that the world would treat me well, but self-esteem issues and a shitty friend that made me feel disposable and not worthy of respect brought me down. I took a semester off from uni studies, got a shitty job, and withdrew myself.

depression,uhlwni,2022-05-03 23:29:48,"Hello everyone,

In november 2020 I started having anxiety, irritability, GI issues, insomnia, brain fog, loss of hair, lack of motivation, dizziness, depersonalisation, Memory loss, chronic fatigue, IBS syndrome, tremors, heart racing, tinnitus, dry mouth, light/noise sensitivity, tachycardia, erectile dysfunction. 

At that time my GI diagnosed me with a ""burnout""/anxiety/depression.

18 months and 6 antidepressants trial later, I still have chronic fatigue, vertigo, brain fog, memory loss and GI issues. I am not dismissing the anxiety/depression since I really felt depressed for months after losing my job and my girlfriend because of chronic fatigue and erectile dysfunction. 

My main concern is that now I don't feel depressed or anxious anymore since at least 9 months but I am still tired as fuck, didn't recovered my cognition and feel dizzy a lot of the time. Is it normal for depressed people to keep this fatigue after ""remission"" to the point they are still not functional ? If yes does it go away ?

I am starting to think my depression was caused by a long haul COVID since I have a confirmed infection and I never had anxiety problems before and this symptoms appeared extremely quickly. From one week to another. Is it possible ? Anyone in the same situation ? Is there a way to tell the difference between long haul and depression ? Is there a solution ? 

I am motivated to do things etc, I juste don't have the energy. I tried Escitalopram 20mg, Effexor 150mg, vortioxetine 10mg, Fluoxetine 40mg, Fluoxetine 20mg + buproprion 150mg.

depression,i0nm3y,2020-07-30 20:34:53,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

depression,tosi88,2022-03-26 20:40:34,"I've experienced depression for about 11 years now. I stopped leaving the house and just felt nothing for a year, then I slowly started learning how to deal with it. It never went away, but I got better and better at managing it.

Fast-forward to this January (2022). I caught COVID (confirmed by multiple tests). The symptoms themselves weren't awful, the worst was just the whole-body aches.

After I recovered from active COVID and started testing negative, I still experienced long COVID for about a month. It was really awful. I could not wake up properly, no matter how much I slept. For a whole month. It was just a constant fog.

Those long COVID symptoms mostly faded away too, but since they have, I've noticed something really weird. It feels like something broke inside me. I just can't experience emptiness anymore. That sort of hopelessness, where nothing matters, where nothing feels good or bad but rather just pointless. It feels like that's just gone.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. But it feels very odd. It doesn't feel like I got better, it feels like something just suddenly broke. I've been used to dealing with hopelessness and emptiness for ~10 years now, and I've had times when I made depression fade away, but it was always there in the background.

It's like. No matter how well I was dealing with depression, I could always feel the hopelessness in the background, and not a rational hopelessness, but just that crushing feeling of raw emptiness. And now I just can't feel that anymore. I try to remember the feeling, but it's just gone?

depression,s55ugc,2022-01-16 12:15:50,"Hey Reddit.

It’s been quite a long road for me to talk about this on a public platform, but I feel like it’s important for me to talk about just to really help myself get better and in hopes that I can help someone else in a similar circumstance. It may be a little long so please bare with me. 

Let me start off with explaining who I am. I’m a 19 year old male from the United States (I’d prefer to keep my identity as anonymous as possible) who’s been fighting a really tough battle with depression. Covid hit near the end of my junior year of high school, and I graduated last May. At the time, I was coming off of my 3rd high school sport season, a season that had seen many accomplishments that I worked my butt off to achieve my first couple years. The future looked bright, I was in an amazing point in my life. I’d struggled with depression my first two years of HS, and even attempted my freshman and sophomore year. However, athletics helped keep me grounded, and going into March 2020, I was in the best shape of my life physically and mentally and emotionally. I was en route to potentially earning a scholarship and making a deep run. To say that I was excited is an understatement.

But then covid hit, almost like a flash of lightning. If only we’d known that the last day of school that March would be our last in person day of high school. The world got shut down, we were forced to isolate. 

Pre-covid I saw myself as a confident, outgoing guy. Always liked being the center of attention and bringing laughter to my friends around me. But the lack of social interaction began to take a serious toll on me. I would just sit in my room all day while my family did whatever they did. That continued all the way up until I graduated, as all my classes my senior year were online. I started to become more antisocial, I started to not wanna be around my family and friends. The little things in life that I once enjoyed now bring me little to no joy. I gained weight, stopped working out, and overall stopped giving a damn about who I was as a person. The last 6 months since I’ve graduated those feelings have been amplified. I’m enrolled in college but all my classes have been distanced learning. I’m not the same person that I was, and that hurts so god damn bad. I don’t even wanna be around anyone anymore. 

The thing that not many people tell you about depression is how fast the time can potentially go by. You’re so caught up in your own mental BS that you forget that time is just flying by, and the harder I try to stop it, the faster it goes. But that’s just life. I still imagine myself walking through the halls of my high school, hopelessly trying to make up for lost time. I still envision myself being a kid, knowing damn well that those days have been gone for a good amount of time now. 

I feel like a loser. I spent so much time focusing on sports that I forgot to get myself prepared post high school. And now that I’m not in sports anymore, I feel like I don’t have a reason to live. I don’t have a job, never even learned how to fkn drive. I’m lost. And every day that I sit in my room feeling sorry for myself the pain digs deeper and deeper. Some might view me as a lazy bastard, and I wouldn’t blame them. I just really wanna know why I feel this way and why apathy has crept it’s way into my soul.

depression,s61xh8,2022-01-17 16:59:18,"(First of all, sorry for my bad English, I'm latino and it's been a while since last time I practiced my writing. And thanks in advance for reading my story, I hope it can help anyone else than me writing this words).

I never got professional help, but I had depression in my early 20's and 'cured' it by myself. The symptoms were the typical: no motivation, feeling shitty, sleepy all day and insomnia at night, loss of memory, lack of focus, difficulty in communicating with others, moments of no libido and other moments being fucking horny. I was a bit depressed previously, but having a gf with a worse condition than mine, made it much worse. I was always worried that she could take her life bc any of my actions. I avoided any confrontation and was always by her side trying to make her happy. Eventually, I helped her in getting professional help, and she got better. The problem was that in that process she realized how toxic was with me all that time and finished our 2 years relationship. That was a hard hit for me, but I honestly felt relived. My depression got worse: I had no gf, no job, my college qualifications were shit, my parents arguing all the time. My friends, trying to being nice, helped me in enjoying social life, and I got into alcohol and pot. I went swimming after some years of inactivity. Then a few months later I got a job that I loved, and a few months later, a car. After a few years journey, I managed to leave all the bad things behind and felt happy. My symptoms were gone.

But then, covid came.

I enjoyed it for the first weeks/months, I'm introverted. But I missed spending time with my friends. Also, lockdown made my job a lot harder, they made me do lot of work everyday and was not payed right. I left collage since I had no time for it. Problems at home got worse. The lack of sex and affection also made me go mad. And then, before I realized, all my symptoms started coming back one by one. I gained a lot of weight, was always stressed, even I started losing a lot of hair. To make it worse, my ex gf seemed really happy with a new guy (I felt good that she was happy, but not that she was happy with other guy).

In 2021, trying to recover my lost happiness, I quit my job and got into collage again. I'm trying to becoming chemical engineer. Started working out, riding my bike and swimming again. It seemed that my life was in the right path. However, some days I'm back again in that mood mess, with all my symptoms coming and going.

More coming that going I'd say. Now I'm 29 y.o. and feel like my life is not as good as it should be. I see my friends getting married, having kids, moving out of the city, and I'm still here, in this shitty city, in this shitty country, unemployed, living with my parents, with no gf, and not seeing my friends as often as I'd wish. I don't know what to do, I'm a bit lost. Everything now feels so complicated, so far away, so unmotivating. And the activities I used to enjoy, now feel so boring. I'm spending my days only studying and watching youtube. I know that I survived depression once and I will beat it again, but there's a long way to walk still.

As that monkey at Bojack's said 'It does get easy but you have to do it everyday, that's the hard part. But it does get easy'.",first sorry bad english latino since last time practiced writing thanks advance reading story hope help anyone else writing words never got professional help depression early 20 symptoms typical motivation feeling shitty sleepy day insomnia night loss memory lack focus difficulty communicating others moments libido moments fucking horny bit depressed previously gf worse condition mine made much worse always worried could take life bc actions avoided confrontation always side trying make happy eventually helped getting professional help got better problem process realized toxic time finished 2 years relationship hard hit honestly felt relived depression got worse gf job college qualifications shit parents arguing time friends trying nice helped enjoying social life got alcohol pot went swimming years inactivity months later got job loved months later car years journey managed leave bad things behind felt happy symptoms gone covid came enjoyed first introverted missed spending time friends also lockdown made job lot harder made lot work everyday payed right left collage since time problems home got worse lack sex affection also made go mad realized symptoms started coming back one one gained lot weight always stressed even started losing lot hair make worse ex gf seemed really happy new guy felt good happy happy guy 2021 trying recover lost happiness quit job got collage trying becoming chemical engineer started working riding bike swimming seemed life right path however days back mood mess symptoms coming going coming going say 29 feel like life good see friends getting married kids moving city still shitty city shitty country unemployed living parents gf seeing friends often wish know bit lost everything feels complicated far away unmotivating activities used enjoy feel boring spending days studying watching youtube know survived depression beat long way walk still monkey bojack said get easy everyday hard part get easy

depression,rswj2y,2021-12-31 21:10:58,"I want to start by saying my experience was probably unique, if you or a loved one is being admitted do not assume my experience will mirror your own. 

After a couple of phone calls with the mental health crisis hotline in my area, I decided to go to my local emergency department. Long story short, they decided I should be involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric ward as I was potentially a danger to myself. 

Fast forward to my first morning there, a new patient gets admitted to my room (4 beds total in the room). No worries, she stays in bed all morning and I go about my day. Shortly after lunch, I am told that I have to immediately move rooms. Turns out, our new roommate tested positive for Covid. They were swabbed prior to admission but I guess the results didn’t come out until that afternoon. After some confusion among nursing staff, it’s decided that those of us who are exposed are to be locked in private rooms, not allowed to leave, for 10 days to self isolate. 

That meant 10 days of no group activities, not talking to anyone at all, no contact with the outside world whatsoever (electronics were forbidden and we had no phones in the room). We didn’t even have clocks on the wall to tell what time it was. 

I was told I couldn’t leave my room to shower, make phone calls, even go for supervised walks outside. Our rooms were too small to walk around or do any kind of exercise, and there were no tables or desks or anything so we were essentially forced to sit in bed to eat our meals and hang out all day. 

My psychiatrist wouldn’t even come into my room or bring me to a private area, he stood outside of my door and I had to loudly explain my feelings to him despite other patients walking by, hearing everything. 

The first night of our isolation I had a full meltdown. I was very stressed about my predicament and wound up having a full panic attack. Another patient helped me through some breathing exercises while several nurses and a physician were in the vicinity and ignored me. One nurse rudely told me to get back into my room (I was standing in the door way) and none of them tried to help or bring my nurse over. My isolation meant I had no way to tell my nurse I needed help. Our rooms had no call bells or anything and I wasn’t allowed to leave my room to go to the nurses station. I stayed in my room panicking until my nurse did her hourly walk around and noticed me. Rather than doing anything to actually help, I was offered a sedative and told there was nothing else they could do. 

I ended up demanding to be discharged the next day (which the psychiatrist was surprisingly ok with) but that was after I had to spend a substantial amount of time in forced isolation and I never even received any psychiatric help whatsoever while I was there. No coping strategies, no diagnosis, no assigned psychiatrist (I saw two on call psychiatrists during my stay). 

All that for an experience that was extremely dehumanizing. I wasn’t allowed to wear my own clothes,  I had to sit in my own filth, I couldn’t take a walk or do anything, and I was treated like a diseased animal because of an exposure that was their fault. One of the nurses that ignored my panic even tried to gaslight me and my family when we brought it up after the fact. 

All this to say that the fear of Covid was prioritized over my own treatment. I left the facility worse than when I came in. Now I have new fears and the sense of isolation and anxiety have persisted despite me having been home around people for at least a day now.",want start saying experience probably unique loved one admitted assume experience mirror couple phone calls mental health crisis hotline area decided go local emergency department long story short decided involuntarily admitted psychiatric ward potentially danger fast forward first morning new patient gets admitted room 4 beds total room worries stays bed morning go day shortly lunch told immediately move rooms turns new roommate tested positive covid swabbed prior admission guess results come afternoon confusion among nursing staff decided us exposed locked private rooms allowed leave 10 days self isolate meant 10 days group activities talking anyone contact outside world whatsoever electronics forbidden phones room even clocks wall tell time told leave room shower make phone calls even go supervised walks outside rooms small walk around kind exercise tables desks anything essentially forced sit bed eat meals hang day psychiatrist even come room bring private area stood outside door loudly explain feelings despite patients walking hearing everything first night isolation full meltdown stressed predicament wound full panic attack another patient helped breathing exercises several nurses physician vicinity ignored one nurse rudely told get back room standing door way none tried help bring nurse isolation meant way tell nurse needed help rooms call bells anything allowed leave room go nurses station stayed room panicking nurse hourly walk around noticed rather anything actually help offered sedative told nothing else could ended demanding discharged next day psychiatrist surprisingly ok spend substantial amount time forced isolation never even received psychiatric help whatsoever coping strategies diagnosis assigned psychiatrist saw two call psychiatrists stay experience extremely dehumanizing allowed wear clothes sit filth take walk anything treated like diseased animal exposure fault one nurses ignored panic even tried gaslight family brought fact say fear covid prioritized treatment left facility worse came new fears sense isolation anxiety persisted despite home around people least day

I have a professor who won’t zoom the course and has been taking her mask off before it was even allowed. I’m terrified of going to her class now. People think I’m paranoid and stupid bc the pandemic is “over” or almost over and it has to end eventually. But for me it’s never been worse. I wasn’t sick the rest of the pandemic, now I am and would end up in the hospital if I got covid. Hell I probably will end up in the hospital soon anyways, I don’t know how I haven’t been already.

We wanted to live together and work for ourself again . When COVID hit all country stared to lockdown and barred people to apply for work and  I couldn't apply for work . At first we thought it's might be only for few months so we both comfort eachother by VC saying everything will be ok soon but months turned a year and 2years still her country hasn't open yet .

I basically haven’t socialized in person with someone besides my partner for the past eight months. I’m afraid I’m going to get fired and then I’ll have no safety net to fall back on, and I can imagine having to move in with family (as they aren’t accepting of me and my partner). 

I’ve been in therapy and it helps some, but I still just feel hopeless and exhausted and overwhelmed 99% of the time. I feel so lonely, and that at this point in my life I’ll never be able to make friends again.

depression,spcfps,2022-02-10 23:21:33,"I caught COVID about a month ago, despite being vaccinated which seems to happen more often with omicron. I had pretty much every symptom in the book. After a week most of the symptoms were gone, I was just left with a nagging cough and shortness of breath. The shortness of breath was the worst and I went to the ER a couple of times but they wouldn't do anything for me, but it did start getting a better after a couple more days.

As my cough and shortness of breath have gone away, they have been replaced by what I can only describe as a dark, suffocating cloud of sadness that has been hanging over me ever since. It kind of started with me randomly one day thinking that I don't want me kids to grow up. I love my life just the way it is right now, and I don't want anything to change, but thats impossible. 

Those thoughts have taken over my mind and made me sad. Uncontrollably sad. Going through my days fighting back tears at every turn kind of sad. My appetite is gone and I have to force myself to eat. I haven't had a good night of sleep in weeks. My chest feels heavy. I don't get pleasure out of any of the normal things I used to, and I don't have a desire to do many of those things anyways. Like I said, I just feel like a heavy, dark, suffocating cloud has enveloped me and I feel nothing except for sadness, worry, and fear. And just a little background about myself, I have NEVER come anywhere close to feeling depressed about anything. I've always been a very happy, content person. I'm lucky to have had and continue to have a really great life, which makes it all the more confusing as to how and why I could possibly be feeling this way seemingly out of nowhere. I have never come close to feeling anything like this in my life.

So what I am asking is, have any of you experienced or heard of someone suffering from depression as a post COVID symptom? Did COVID screw up the chemistry in my brain? Is post COVID depression a thing?

depression,s9hd7s,2022-01-21 23:57:37,"I (41m) lost most of my vision back in June after a cataract surgery went wrong. I have been legally blind for years, but I still had a lot of functional vision in my good eye. That was mostly gone after June. Needless to say, I sunk into a deep depression. My relationship with my girlfriend at the time imploded a few months later mostly due to my untreated mental illness. 

I am now living with my parents while I wait for resources to help me become more independent. My ex girlfriend and I still talk from time to time. We had considered reconciling, but it appears that may be in the distant future, if it happens at all, and I need to cut contact with her for awhile so I can move on.

I saw a doctor a few weeks ago and scheduled a corneal transplant that could restore my vision. It was scheduled for a few days from today. 

Well, my parents are not careful about Covid at all. My sister is an anti-vaxxer and she is constantly sending her daughter over because she doesn’t want to deal with her behaviour problems. My parents constantly drive my niece to and from her parents, and we are constantly catching colds from them because they don’t tell us when they have been sick. well, sure enough, me and my mother tested positive for Covid a couple of days ago. Because of this, I have had to postpone my surgery a full month later. 

So now I’m stuck in bed with Covid. I was already very secluded up to now, and was very anxious about the surgery and the time I had to wait for it. It was hard enough when I had to wait three weeks. On top of that, I am still dealing with extreme heartbreak over my ex. She is one of the few people I can talk to, but needless to say I need some distance from her to move on. This would be difficult under normal circumstances, but with my blindness and seclusion it is near impossible for me not to contact her. 

And then there’s the seclusion itself. I’m having to relearn how to use the internet with a screenreader, and social media is difficult. My parents live in the suburbs of a small Texas town, and as I can’t drive there is nowhere to go even when I don’t have Covid.

depression,hlzkor,2020-07-06 08:17:39,"At the start of this year, I got hired at an amazing new job that made me feel better than I had for a couple years. Management and coworkers were positive and kind, which makes a job incredible by itself. It was within walking distance of a train line, which is perfect because I wouldn't have to transfer to a bus after getting off the train, so my commute was a lot shorter. Best of all, the job required tons of walking which is the icing on the cake because I've been trying to lose weight for years but never managed to. I downloaded Samsung Health and checked it at the end of a shift and I was incredulous when I saw how many calories I burned. There's no way I could motivate myself to exercise for 8 hours a day, but when I do it at work the time just flies by 😁

My self-esteem has always been low in part due to being overweight. When I lost 2 pounds this March, I was ecstatic realizing that at that rate, in about a year, I'd finally be at a healthy body weight for the first time in my life. And at the same time I would be earning steady source of income so I could pay off a bit of credit card debt and save up some money so I'm not living paycheck to paycheck anymore, all while enjoying myself at work. I was elated and felt better than I had in a couple years. It was like a dream job.

At the end of March, **COVID-19 showed up and ruined everything**. I've been stuck at home miserable for 3 and a half months now, and it feels like it all may have been a dream for real. My anxiety has worsened, and all I can do is overthink about every single thing all day. I sit at home and eat and drink, gaining more weight I don't want.  Painful memories from years ago have come flooding back, experiences that I never wanted to think about again. Instead of wiping out my credit card debt, I'm back to only being able to afford the minimum payments again.

I just want to get back to work and get on with my life. I live with my mom and I'm receiving government benefits, so becoming homeless isn't a concern, but I still want to feel like a meaningful working member of society, be healthy (physically and mentally), have savings of my own, and achieve some sort of independence in my lifetime. It's not like I can live with my parents till I'm 100. There was no lockdown in the state I'm in so I can go out for a walk. But a 30 minute walk everyday isn't going to compare to 8 hours of exercise.

I didn't stress out about COVID-19 at first because I thought it would be like Ebola, H1N1, SARS etc. where the media makes it sound bad, but most of the population wouldn't end up affected. But at the end of March, things got serious and our company's flagship client temporarily stopped using our services. Without their business, a huge chunk of our workforce became redundant. Since I was one of the most recently hired and had the least seniority, I was among the first to be laid off.

It wouldn't be so bad if I had a definite recall date I knew I had to tough it out until. But there's no knowing when the major client will start using my company's services again. Even once they do, I was one of the last new staff to be hired, so I won't be recalled till the company ramps their operations back to 100% pre-pandemic levels. Tons of smaller clients have gone out of business, so there's going to be gaps in the demand for my company's services for a long time, possibly years.

The thought of interviewing for another job is a nightmare for me. Transiting to some unfamiliar location to meet with a stranger and bluff my way through an interview hoping they don't notice how socially inept I am isn't my idea of a good time. Especially when I just went through that unpleasant process so recently, and I didn't even do anything to deserve losing my job and needing to go through the process again.

I feel like the frog jumping out of the well, who slides back down no matter how hard he leaps. I'm starting to think maybe I was never meant to be successful and I was placed on this planet only to fail and be miserable.

I was recently diagnosed with COVID and have fallen extremely behind in my classes, and have received a lot of criticism from peers since my diagnosis. People blamed me for being sick, shunned me, and left me to “think about my actions,and how they affect others”. I’ve been confined to a room for weeks, with the school monitoring my every move..I’m feeling extremely suicidal and overall just very sad and lost.

I have finals next week, and an overwhelming amount of homework due, but all I can find the strength to do is sleep,eat,cry, repeat. I’m struggling to write my essays or study for my exams. 

I’m really worried about my mental health. I had a therapist who, because of the semester ending, had ended our sessions a few days ago. 

My mother, is putting a lot of pressure on me to do well in school, and I’m letting her and my whole family down. I’m currently facing a potential explosion from college for problems with my roommate and I having a guest over at the dorms ...

I’m also having a lot of problems with my boyfriend who; since me becoming depressed and gaining weight has seemingly lost interest in me... 

I apologize if my writing seems just like I’m complaining , I hate to be that girl... but I don’t know who else to talk to right now..

I even had to change my resume several times over the last 2 months for it to look good just to have a chance for it to be seen. 

I spoke to my mum about my plans last night. I told her that if I couldn’t find a part time job, I’d just work at a fast food restaurant or as a packer but she immediately shut that idea down. She said I was “above” such jobs as a degree holder. I mean she had a point but I told her that it was just to make money until I could land a real job but she was like “No. I’d rather you keep on attending online workshops or work at a ‘higher class job’.” She said she could support the family just fine but looking at her right now, she just looks stressed  and she’s taking that stress out on me. She says right now the country has no place for aspiring video maker like me. And the graphic design scene is competitive now too which is why I haven’t gotten a job in either of those fields.

So what’s left for me then? Take up a language or skills course? Keep trying to job hunt but cast my net wider? I guess I could work in a higher class cafe and restaurant. I could even become a librarian or get involved with charity.

Thinking about the future is worrying but Presently, I have an interview for a content creation position next Monday.

depression,pe9otu,2021-08-30 08:33:18,Prior to covid I was living with roommates in a city. I always had friends to go out and do whatever with. I work in a hospital so I continued to work during Covid. My one roommate moved home to save money working from home and another moved in with her boyfriend. We were all 26/27 at the time. I moved in myself and it is so isolating. Post quarantine all of my friends have moved in with boyfriends or gotten engaged. I now just turned 29 and feel so dumb. My friends don’t go out anymore because they’re all in relationships. Yet on the rare occasions I do see my friends I’m always asked why I’m not out at the bars etc trying to meet new people…. with what friends????

depression,qdkynn,2021-10-22 22:15:16,"Had a nasty bout with COVID in July (was down and out for about 3 weeks with 9 days in my IMCU having pulse ox as low as 70). I’ve slowly been bouncing back but it’s been HARD to say the least.

In the weeks & months following my release from the hospital, it’s been an EXHAUSTING experience getting back to work (I’m currently an audit contractor for a Big 4 CPA firm). I don’t draw a salary (hourly only) nor do I have the capacity to deal with the disability mess (not like they’d pay out enough to cover my mandatory expenses as far as I can tell). Missing those 3 weeks (plus another week due to a pneumothorax a few weeks later) had a nasty impact on my household financial status. Not to mention the medical bills from those two hospitalizations are coming in and are not pretty (yes, I had insurance, thankfully, but my payment responsibility for those two hospitalizations is very high regardless).

On top of all that, I found out yesterday that my daughter has been diagnosed with ASD (meaning both her AND my son in on the spectrum and am struggling to figure out our plan to address those challenges).

I had a nasty depressive episode in mid 2019 (due to an accumulation of years of various personal & professional challenges and my upbringing issues never being resolved properly) and was on 20MG Escitalopram and seeing a weekly therapist until I felt stable enough to handle life without both. Things seemed to have been moving okay even with a few more bumps until the infection. Now, things feel like a giant mess that won’t stop piling on.

I’m constantly exhausted, feel weak all the time, prone to having exaggerated symptoms from something like a simple cold (apparently due to my body already working overtime from the COVID infection), can’t concentrate at work for long periods of time (thus affecting my overall work quality), and on top of all that having to juggle the responsibilities of two autistic kids while my wife is pushing through her studies (she’s done next May but having to basically isolate her from the kids so she can study uninterrupted is yet another thing to pile on).

I’m inclined to conclude that all these issues have triggered another episode (as familiar depressive symptoms are showing) but how would I honestly be able to tell for sure? Is it time to go back to my PCP and talk about getting back on meds and therapy or should I give myself a bit more time to get more healed up from the infection and build some strength back up?",nasty bout covid july 3 weeks 9 days imcu pulse ox low 70 slowly bouncing back hard say least weeks months following release hospital exhausting experience getting back work currently audit contractor big 4 cpa firm draw salary hourly capacity deal disability mess like pay enough cover mandatory expenses far tell missing 3 weeks plus another week due pneumothorax weeks later nasty impact household financial status mention medical bills two hospitalizations coming pretty yes insurance thankfully payment responsibility two hospitalizations high regardless top found yesterday daughter diagnosed asd meaning son spectrum struggling figure plan address challenges nasty depressive episode mid 2019 due accumulation years various personal professional challenges upbringing issues never resolved properly 20mg escitalopram seeing weekly therapist felt stable enough handle life without things seemed moving okay even bumps infection things feel like giant mess stop piling constantly exhausted feel weak time prone exaggerated symptoms something like simple cold apparently due body already working overtime covid infection concentrate work long periods time thus affecting overall work quality top juggle responsibilities two autistic kids wife pushing studies done next may basically isolate kids study uninterrupted yet another thing pile inclined conclude issues triggered another episode familiar depressive symptoms showing would honestly able tell sure time go back pcp talk getting back meds therapy give bit time get healed infection build strength back

depression,gpybjg,2020-05-25 03:28:44,"In the last decade I have been in a nearly fatal car accident, went through cancer that left me infertile, got divorced and lived under constant stress due to financial uncertainty (mid crisis Greece), among several other smaller things. 
We had a somewhat successful small business that had a lot of potential, but it was hit extremely hard by the economic crisis in Greece and amassed a lot of debt.
I have been in high-functioning depression for most of my life. I'm a textbook overthinker and I'm very prone to fits of self-pity, which can be pretty debilitating. I've also had problems with motivation and self discipline. Practicing stoicism and reading (popularised) neuroscience books helped me to understand what I'm feeling and accept it. This actually got me out of that rut, and I have managed to not feel genuinely depressed for a few years now, even during the afore mentioned hard times, though I do still struggle with motivation a bit.
In the last few years, China and Chinese investors have invested a lot of money in Greece, so I thought I would learn Chinese, in hopes of finding a better job. On May/2019, after 3 years of Chinese lessons, I got a job at a real estate agency, dealing with Chinese customers. We are only on a commission basis, but it's quite substantial, for Greek standards, and Chinese clients actually have a much larger purchase  percentage than any other ethnicity, so I started out very strong. I had several Chinese clients, with arranged flights from February to June 2020, which is actually off-season, and lots more were bound to visit Greece during July and August. After almost 10 years, I was finally able to be realistically optimistic. If things continued that way, I would have been able to get my parents and I out of debt, within 8-9 years, while living modestly, but without worries. 
Now, after one and a half months of no operation, we have to file for bankruptcy for our family business, my parents may lose their house and I will have to find a dead end job, with a steady but low salary, just to make ends meet.

depression,jwmb5r,2020-11-19 00:49:39,"Yes it did. And I did not get infected. Here's my story-

After passing through the teen phase of my life that was pretty messed up I finally got away from my family, to a different city, for my master's degree. 

I was scared at first but things really took a turn for the good and for the first time in my life I realised how great life can be. Got a girlfriend, good grades and I was doing what I love. 

Until COVID hit in March and everyone was told to vacate the campus premises and come back home. It's been eight months since then and these eight months have made me nearly consider suicide. 

I broke up with my girlfriend. The distance got the better of us, I can't find a job, I lost all my friends, the friends I made in that city and lost touch with the ones here at home. I have an extremely dysfunctional family that does not understand my situation. I've done my best to try and explain that I can't take these fights that go on. Afterall, the reason I liked it there more was that there was no family abuse. 

After gathering alot of courage today I decided to confront my family and tell them that they are worsening things for me. And the result, I got beaten to the blues by my physically and mentally abusive brother and hurled cusses and scoldings by my mentally abusive father. My mother tries to help me but it's just too much to take. 

I haven't been exposed to Covid-19 thus far. But it fucked up my life in every other possible way it could. The months I spent away from home made me realise that life can truly be blissful and then everything got taken away.

depression,ow26ho,2021-08-02 04:17:47,"The worst thing about depressed people is that they think that somehow being sad means they’re qualified to give good advice. Unfortunately, I am no different. And of all the advice I could give anyone, it would be that dreams are stupid.

There should be two things in your life, 1. Long term goals and 2. Short term
Joys. Do NOT have stupid far off future dreams. There can be shit you want to accomplish, but that shouldn’t be something you hope for or look forward to, it should be something you fully expect to never achieve.

And if you want shit that actually makes you happy, it should be stuff in the moment. Anything that you have to plan more than a week in advance literally isn’t even worth considering. At that point the risk of random bullshit getting in the way is too high to justify the hope. Instead, you should focus on more immediate joys in your life.

I think about all the time in high school I wasted working towards some stupid dream of going to some fancy school to live my perfect life. I did the work, got to the fancy school, and then the world fucking ended. Maybe I don’t even regret all the time I spent working for that, but I shouldn’t have been delusional about the prospect that something that far off in the future could ever have made me happy. Instead I should have tried to seize the joy of the here and now.

Honestly the best way to live life is as if there’s a 50% chance the world will end on Friday. Sure, you’ve got to prepare for the future, but you’ve also got to seize the time you’ve got, because for all you know the future is just gonna be a ball of fire.",worst thing depressed people think somehow sad means qualified give good advice unfortunately different advice could give anyone would dreams stupid two things life long term goals short term joys stupid far future dreams shit want accomplish something hope look forward something fully expect never achieve want shit actually makes happy stuff moment anything plan week advance literally even worth considering point risk random bullshit getting way high justify hope instead focus immediate joys life think time high school wasted working towards stupid dream going fancy school live perfect life work got fancy school world fucking ended maybe even regret time spent working delusional prospect something far future could ever made happy instead tried seize joy honestly best way live life 50 chance world end friday sure got prepare future also got seize time got know future gon na ball fire

depression,oxxdzi,2021-08-04 22:44:23,"I don't have many friends or keep in contact with many, people, previously I felt a lot of pain through this, but then just decided to not give a fuck and live my own life and if people dont contact me I let it go.

To the point where I wasn't in contact with many people, I contracted COVID and was very sick, I had my mother to take care of me, oh yeah also at 33 I had to move back becuase u lost my job.

I realised I had barely anyone to tell I was sick, barley anyone asking if I was ok, all these years and I haven't managed to build a network that cared about me. No one checking up on me but my mom and brother, there was a night I felt like I am dying, I couldn't breathe. And it wouldnt matter much, 

My ex wife who I have beautiful children with, we keep breaking up and getting back together in a toxic cycle where she tells me what a piece of shit I am but then when I leave she blames me for ""breaking up the family"" she also keeps me from making friends with jealousy.

I realised I could just die, everyday my body is decaying, I've applied for so many jobs, and I have gotten 8 interviews and haven't landed a single one. Before Zoom interviews I've landed every single one of my jobs, but post that in Zoom I can't land any, after the interview I just don't hear back.

Also, my parents are, are getting rid of this house and moving abroad in a few months and Literally don't have a single cent and with my Ex wife asking me to get back and move back with the family is my only option, but I know she will start treating my like shit in a few days, her making all the money and paying for everything while I have nothing. 

And to be honest I don't even blame her for it becuase I don't offer anything as a man.

The only reason I don't kill myself is becuase, I don't want to put my kids through that, my 14 year old doesn't talk to anyone he's always either gaming or ignoring everyone, he goes to sleep at 2am and even though I've spoken to my ex about she told me she makes the money so she will parent. I get no respect from the kids. Although my 8 year old has a very good relationship with me and looks up to me.

I don't think I've been such a bad guy in life I have ADHD I struggle with work and remembering things, but I'm not an asshole and always try my best but it's never good enough.

I am also suffering from what I believe to be long haul covid symptoms, I am very tired, even more than normal, I am trying to wake up early but mid day I fall asleep and then sleep most of the night, my lungs and breathing is so bad that I can't even run or work out like I used to to improve mood.

I am mentally and physically exhausted, I am broke, I am lonely, I am rejected by job after job, and my ex/partner treats me like shit, but also is the only one sending me money and doing things to help me so that even makes me feel worse.

In top of that I just know traumatic experiences are waiting for me, my grandmother parents, and aunts who I am fairly close with will die, and these are just trauma incidents waiting for me. Even if I dig myself out of this episode, I most likely there will just be more episodes in the future becuase I always fuck up anyway.

Even if I get a job and leave my ex, I will have to deal with not seeing my kids, she is very smart, savvy and manipulative, I can't win against her, I will see my kids with a stepdad and it will be a reminder of what I failure I am and how I couldn't keep my family together becuase I'm a loser.

My brother age 18 is also off to study in the U.S my stepdad an American Citizen who married my mom when I was 15 could have submitted some forms which would have given me access to the US but it has to be done before you are 18 and he didn't do it for me even though I begged them to do it, I had a chance to live in the U.S to get opportunities as apposed to South Africa with the high crime and lack of jobs but he couldn't do a simple form.

He calls my brother everyday and tell him he loves which he didn't do for me, he took my brother to tour England and the U.S and I have never left the country. He is making sure his son gets every opportunity but always got mad whenever my mom did something for me and my education and none of this ever gets talked about I have to smile like nothing happened.

My dad also didn't pay attention to me and went on having his own family even though I enjoyed being around him, his personality and so on.

When I have arguments with my ex wife she also reminds me that my father or stepfather doesn't love me or want my becuase of ""the type of person I am""

depression,n92g4b,2021-05-10 17:12:53,"Long story short, I lost my job last year in August.It was a job I had worked 5 years at and had hoped could be my career and it was something I was doing well in. Due to it being in the creative industry, sadly my role had to be furloughed and I couldn't work from home. At first, I was okay with this, but after a few months of being furloughed, I started to worry, I was asking my manager if my job was ok and was constantly being told 'Your job is fine'. But after one week of being told that, I was made redundant.And since then I've struggled in finding work or a job I can keep. I got myself a job in November 2020 which I was super happy about and it sadly lasted up until mid-January as the situation repeated itself and I lost that job due to the UK going into another lockdown.Every day since January, I've been applying for jobs, looking for any type of work, but work where it of course pays a decent living amount as I have bills to pay.

I've now gotten to that point where I no longer know what I want to do with myself. I'm 28 and I know I'm not the only one in this situation. But I sit here now and just feel useless. Because I had originally had a decent job, not had to worry about a lot, had moved out, and started to really feel like things were working out for me after fighting for so much. And now it's all changed in one year. I get rejected for jobs I fit. I've gone and taken classes to build my confidence up when it comes to interviews as I now lack confidence and have developed Anxiety. I've had my CV looked at and changed so many times. I've applied for courses or apprenticeships in hopes I can maybe develop my skills so it gets easier when applying for jobs. The government's UC doesn't support as much as they make out to and throw any old job at you.

And now my family's become un-supportive too. I've noticed any job I apply for which has something in it which I've not done before or something I haven't got a lot of experience in, my family automatically judge me for it and say: ""'Oh can you cope"" or ""You don't have the skills for that"". And it makes me feel utter rubbish because when I apply I put so much effort into it all and feel confident about myself, that when they say those things I then feel I won't be successful. My mums even started saying things like: ""Oh now I need to go get a job just to support you as you can't get one"".

I'm writing this just so I don't feel alone really. And in hopes, others are in the same situation.I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried recruitment agencies, but they throw jobs that they find  in locations I can't even get to without it costing me a lot. I'm at that point it's not worth fighting for anymore. My family says they are supportive, but when I ask for the support they don't give it. I just feel covid has truly messed my life up.

Any advice on things I can do to not feel this way would be great. One step I've taken is that I've applied to volunteer at local places near me just to get out there again and to gain my confidence back. But job-wise and things, I don't know what to do anymore.

Thanks for reading.

\*\*Edit:\*\*I've been applying for everything, from part-time, full time, share jobs, apprenticeships etc.It does above sound like I'm being picky. But I'm constantly being told by my family also not to take low money jobs due to bills. Which is not helping the situation and my mindset. I'm trying not to be picky in jobs and am applying for almost everything that comes up. But at the same time, applying for almost anything for the sake of it and to just try and get a job isn't getting me anywhere.",long story short lost job last year job worked 5 years hoped could career something well due creative industry sadly role furloughed could work home first okay months furloughed started worry asking manager job ok constantly told job fine one week told made since struggled finding work job keep got job november 2020 super happy sadly lasted situation repeated lost job due uk going another day since january applying jobs looking type work work course pays decent living amount bills pay gotten point longer know want 28 know one situation sit feel useless originally decent job worry lot moved started really feel like things working fighting much changed one year get rejected jobs fit gone taken classes build confidence comes interviews lack confidence developed anxiety cv looked changed many times applied courses apprenticeships hopes maybe develop skills gets easier applying jobs government uc support much make throw old job family become noticed job apply something done something got lot experience family automatically judge say cope skills makes feel utter rubbish apply put much effort feel confident say things feel wo successful mums even started saying things like oh need go get job support ca get one writing feel alone really hopes others know anymore tried recruitment agencies throw jobs find locations ca even get without costing lot point worth fighting anymore family says supportive ask support give feel covid truly messed life advice things feel way would great one step taken applied volunteer local places near get gain confidence back things know anymore thanks reading edit applying everything full time share jobs apprenticeships sound like picky constantly told family also take low money jobs due bills helping situation mindset trying picky jobs applying almost everything comes time applying almost anything sake try get job getting anywhere
depression,olvyhw,2021-07-17 08:22:25,"A little background: I finally found a seasonal job serving a few years back that granted me the most financial security I'd ever had. I paid off my debts. I bought a new car. I was planning to save up for a house. I thought I was a good server. I was personable with the guests, always on time, rarely called in, and wanted to work nights. I thought I was valued.
Then covid hit and we shut down like everyone else. When things reopened, we had reduced our seating in half, so they didn't bring back all the servers yet. The season came and went. I ended up working for a friend at her local business for the rest of the summer and made ends meet through Uber in the winter.
As the next season came around, my job brought back all the remaining servers... Except four. Obviously, I was one of them.
I called my lead and she explained that she ""couldn't"" tell me WHY I wasn't picked to come back. She said I was one of her favorites because I was reliable and worked evenings. 
Then, as the season got into full swing, there was talk of adding more seats. And then they put up applications for new servers. Some co-workers suggested I reapply, but my thought was, ""they've still got four of us on furlough, they can call us.""
They never did. 
.
.
Now, I'm just bitter. My best friend just posted pictures from her 5-year Pinning Ceremony and I want to be happy for her... But my 5-years should have been in 2020. I was denied what I saw as a career, or at least a means to reach some long-term financial goals. I loved my job. I loved my co-workers. We were a family. And then someone in management decided my future for me. For reasons I never got to know. And now I struggle to tell my best friend ""congratulations,"" when I really feel bitterness instead.

depression,m5aym0,2021-03-15 08:17:29,"It feels weird to say I ""struggle"" with depression because I don't feel like it's a struggle anymore. At this point it's just my existence. And I'm usually pretty good at dealing with it until COVID hit and all of my coping mechanisms slid into the Hell No Zone.

Pre-COVID, I was a pro at depression. I take my meds daily. I did the exercise thing and played football (soccer) on a team. I did the healthy eating thing. I spent time with friends. And when I was feeling super low, I made sure to get outside and watch the sunset every day (it's my thing). I joined a dance studio. I reached out to friends even more. All that shit. And I could always get back to kicking it with my dark thoughts like roommates. I was good.

But COVID killed half of that, and med-school finished the job. My school is in a very small town. There's no football. No dance studios. No grocery stores within walking distance (I don't have a car so I rent once a month). None of my classmates wear masks off campus, but I haven't made any friends anyway so it only matters that different campus facilities are always getting shut down for cleaning.

So now all I have are my meds. And the sun, lol. But I've been depressed long enough to know that those can only go so far. All the other healthy life stuff was like a pill booster that helped crank out more of that delicious dopamine and sweet sweet serotonin.

But now my struggle bus is parked in the No Motivation Zone with the steering lock on.",feels weird say struggle depression feel like struggle anymore point existence usually pretty good dealing covid hit coping mechanisms slid hell zone pro depression take meds daily exercise thing played football soccer team healthy eating thing spent time friends feeling super low made sure get outside watch sunset every day thing joined dance studio reached friends even shit could always get back kicking dark thoughts like roommates good covid killed half finished job school small town football dance studios grocery stores within walking distance car rent month none classmates wear masks campus made friends anyway matters different campus facilities always getting shut cleaning meds sun lol depressed long enough know go far healthy life stuff like pill booster helped crank delicious dopamine sweet sweet serotonin struggle bus parked motivation zone steering lock

A few days later I realized I felt icky. And now for months since I was infected in mid November it feels like I lost the ability to feel enjoyment.

When I wake I feel horrible. Like waking into a nightmare.

My only relief is sleep. Thats when the pain stops. 

I call doctors to get a neurologist and hit brick walls.

Spent the whole year alone. I have no friends anyways but spent Christmas away from family. Everyone’s older now. I feel death and scared of death for loved ones because they’re all I have. But I didn’t even see them. I lay all day indoors. My eczema resurfaced after fall of last year. Every time I’m outside for more than 10 minutes, I get severe eczema flares. Dont know why. Still happens and still won’t stop. 

Every day I wanna kill myself. But can’t do that to my mom. I won’t do it either so pls don’t send the cops on me. People have done that and cops fucking suck on mental health calls. So I’m not doing shit. I see no point to life. And I work exhaustively. 9-5 work, 6-12 school. I’m on a monitor every day. My apartment is empty and unpacked bc my old career required moving every 8 months. My new job I work exhaustively bc I’m scared of the job hunt and scared of all the stress from having no benefits or healthcare..the CONSTANT Screening interview calls, the ghosting, the presentations, the rejections. Now I just work out of fear and my workplace hasn’t even propagated that. It’s just me and my fear.

I’ll never date. I will always be alone. I’m pale with eczema and hate my body and wear girdles to bed because I hate myself so much. I’m better off dead. 26 and no friends.

depression,jxs7km,2020-11-20 21:59:39,"I haven't gotten anything done for several months. Not in my studies, not in my work, not in any life outside of these. Most days I spend laying on the bed, knowing what I should do, but somehow I reason that I can postpone these things. Nevertheless, the lingering feeling of work left undone brings further fatigue, despite me not working and just laying on the bed.

I feel like a disappointment, although I wasn't always like this. Since the Spring, I've been more or less isolated alone in my tiny one bedroom apartment. In this time, my fatigue has grown, seemingly without good reason, since I haven't worked or studied all that much. This feeling of not accomplishing anything adds on to my disappointment in myself. I'm in my early-to-mid twenties pursuing a master's degree, and every second that I postpone working on my studies, I risk postponing my graduation by six months (I have to accomplish a certain amount of study credits by January, the deficit caused by unproductivity in the Spring). Despite of this I can rarely get anything done until a deadline looms dangerously close, even then I have began to miss them, where as before I'd still be able to get things done. I have a left courses unfinished, which further aids in adding to my depression(?). 

Worst part of this is, is that this is no-ones fault but mine. I'm the one who should study, I'm the one who should work, I've been able to do these things before. I haven't discussed these feelings with anyone in my life, not because they wouldn't care, but because I don't want to change their view of me. I feel alone. I am alone. On the rare occasion I do meet people (friends/family), I pretend that all is well.

depression,mca2z6,2021-03-24 22:00:51,"Hi, I am 17 years old, growing up I have never had the easiest life. I grew up in an abusive childhood, and so have a lot of people. My dad is someone who couldn’t get his life together, and my mom is a mentally unhinged person full of uncontrolled emotion and vindictive actions. I have thought she has a disorder, most likely yes. 

Growing up in the challenges that faced me I grew stronger from them, being put under dark times, during childhood, emotionally, physically and mentally, I’ve had to overcome them. I’ve had to overcome bullying, weight gain, school, and even getting hit. Facing all of these challenges throughout my childhood has strengthened me as a person, and because of it up until 2 years ago, I was on a good track with my life. 

I understood the world in a better way, and I realized how important a career is, and started focusing on that, focusing on what my life is in the future. That is until covid hit...after covid started I had to move to my dads, because my mother was too much to handle and I couldn’t get forward, I was trying to get my license at the time. 

Covid 19 has had a major impact on my life. It ruined everything..my knowledge with the career I’m studying, my motivation, my social life, having fun. 

Now here is the major point of this post. Covid 19 has made me depressed in many many ways, the ones listed above are just the few. But I do not feel like I know what will happen in the future, what my future will be. There is no more security in this world anymore. And the masks depress me, I can’t see anyone’s face, I can’t socially interact while being socially distant. I can’t do anything anymore, and it makes you really question what is the point of all of it? What’s the point if you can’t even have the freedom to do what you want to do?

I will be honest. Covid 19 is overblown, fake or real, it’s ridiculous how far this is going, and it’s wrong. For something with an extremely low death rate, annually there is 100% other motives for continuing covid 19 lockdowns. It’s wrong, people’s freedoms, liberties? Are being destroyed for something that isn’t that big of a deal, breaking in constitution? As you can tell I’m political, but I’m also human, who has experienced these things just as others have. If I am being right down honest, I could say a ton about how this is overblown and being used for evil purposes. But I won’t, this is about how it’s made me feel trying to live a normal life.

Because of all of this, I can’t even get out of bed in the morning, I’ve had OCD that has developed immensely, and I’m always worrying about the future. It’s dehumanizing when you can’t see someone’s face, when you can’t smell, when you have to stay far enough away from someone you can’t have a connection, you feel nothing but alone, and people just go with it.. because at least they have Snapchat right?. 

I’ve been trying to go on a spiritual journey for myself but I’ve always been stopped by all of what is going on now, my absences in school have spiked more than any other year, nearing 30-40 absences I can’t even keep count, if feels like I physically cannot move in the morning, and I have no energy when I do wake up and get out of bed. I used to work out a lot, and now that is ruined too. I’m sorry but you can’t wear a mask in a gym, it DOES restrict your breathing and you need oxygen when lifting heavy weight. Especially when you’re challenging yourself. 

I just have no energy anymore, I’ve already had so much affect my mind, and soul, and now with this, it has made it drastically worse. And if covid 19 made sense and I felt it was legit, and we were being helped, I would have that motivation to get up, but this is wrong, and none of it makes sense, no data adds up, nothing is legit, etc, I could go on and on about it.

So how do I get that energy back? That drive? What are my reasons to keep going? What are the reasons I should even try? Why am I doing what I’m doing? And how do I get out of bed in the morning? I’ve thought about suicide a lot too, and at this point, I just feel so desensitized, lost, alone and insecure of the future, and it has gotten to me, so what can strengthen me, what can even give me as much ambition, drive, curiosity, and hope as a little kid would have. What do I do, because I want to feel like that again, be empowered to have the drive, to be successful, to work out again, to succeed through this bullshit pandemic?

I have no real friend, never had a girlfriend, no job, no diploma, no money and things seems to keep getting worse no matter what I do. I simply cannot continue losing everything like this or I will end up in the street. I have also done many bad things I now need to live with.

My hobbies are boring, my education is stunted, and I’m cooped up in the house all day. 

I can’t even make myself feel better by saying “Well, it’s temporary. This will be over and go back to normal some day”

Hi...first off...not an antivaxxer....signed up as soon as I could to get it. Healthcare worker who has been taking care of COVID patients all along and familiar with the devastation it has caused..just someone desperate to feel better or hoping I’m not alone. No one I know has had issues 

Full disclosure: I have had (minor, short) issues with depression before

26F Received my first Pfizer COVID vaccine in January. Never developed anything more than a sore arm, but the next day I noticed I was feeling a bit down, which I thought was weird given how excited I’d been about it and how few issues I’d had with depression in the past several years. Chalked it up to winter blues and went on my way. Also had an early period and pretty severe cramps, but didn’t think much of it. The depression/slight blues went away over the next week

Second dose also in January: Barely noticeable low grade fever. But about 15 hours later I noticed the feeling of depression coming back. Except this time it didn’t go away and it evolved into the worst depression I’ve ever had. Complete with almost compulsive suicidal ideation, crying and sleeping the entire day, inability to eat, inability to work. It’s beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. I know it could be coincidental, and at this point it’s probably more of a snowball effect than the drug itself. But the timing seems so right for the initial issues to have been caused by the vaccine. 

Like I said, not sure it’s the vaccine, but I almost wish I never would have gotten it just to rule out the possibility. Hell, I’d almost take my dice roll on just contracting COVID now that I know my family is vaccinated. 

Has anyone else had any depression post vaccine??? Did anything help it??? For reference I’m now on a handful of meds and seeing a psychiatrist and therapist consistently for the first time in my life.",hi first antivaxxer signed soon could get healthcare worker taking care covid patients along familiar devastation caused someone desperate feel better hoping alone one know issues full disclosure minor short issues depression 26f received first pfizer covid vaccine january never developed anything sore arm next day noticed feeling bit thought weird given excited issues depression past several years chalked winter blues went way also early period pretty severe cramps think much blues went away next week second dose also january barely noticeable low grade fever 15 hours later noticed feeling depression coming back except time go away evolved worst depression ever complete almost compulsive suicidal ideation crying sleeping entire day inability eat inability work beyond anything ever experienced know could coincidental point probably snowball effect drug timing seems right initial issues caused vaccine like said sure vaccine almost wish never would gotten rule possibility hell almost take dice roll contracting covid know family vaccinated anyone else depression post vaccine anything help reference handful meds seeing psychiatrist therapist consistently first time life

But for people who do enjoy that sort of thing: travel, shopping, conventions, concerts, sports, bars, etc. How sad is it that social interaction, that human connection, of being with other people and sharing in something you enjoy and experiencing it together--- that's likely out the window for quite a while even after the vaccine has arrived and it's safer to congregate. Because people will be afraid. We see each other not as human beings, friends, family, neighbors, etc., but as walking disease carriers. Dangerous to be around, forbidden to touch or to breathe the same air. Gathering in a crowd will be seen as unspeakable. Even after people do feel safe enough to attempt it, you can bet masks and social distancing are here to stay for good.

Things like sex and kissing are disgusting now. Hugs, shaking hands, affectionate touch. Again, a form of human/emotional connection. Unthinkable nowadays. (I understand if you don't like being touched- I don't really- but I do not speak for other people).

And this pandemic has caused so much death, wreaked so much havoc, I don't see how normal life will go on in the same form it did since the beginning of time. People are terrified, of each other and the outside world. And I don't see that fear going away anytime soon.

No, human interaction will mostly be virtual. Over the computer or smartphone. Now that streaming movies is the future, theaters are on their way out too- another communal experience potentially lost forever.

All they said was that they are there if I need them or wanna talk and me being an introvert will never text or call first.

depression,iirhkn,2020-08-29 17:51:30,"I’m 21, and in college. I’ve had some pretty bad depression for a couple years, but I had managed to coast, but ever since this year it’s really cemented that I’m deeply lonely. All of the online classes have made me realize how much I miss interacting with people in person. I hate my job, but I’ve been working it a bunch just to get some social interaction; because, I’m starting to feel insane in my depression. Talking to someone I genuinely like just kinda brings me back to reality.

I find myself really jealous of other people’s relationships with people lately. I see friends family’s who have healthy relationships with their family. I never knew my dad, and my mom has anger problems so I just grew up scared and resentful of her as a kid. I have a younger sister, but we’re not that close. My relationship with my family has gotten better, but I don’t feel comfortable around them still. I haven’t had any romantic relationships for 2 years. I feel like I need to find one, but I haven’t found much luck there. I feel like I’ve strained my friendships these past few years, because of depression. And hysterical moments because of that. I feel like the circle of people I know is just getting smaller. I wish I had better relationships during this time. I regret a lot of the decisions I’ve made these past few years, and I wish I could go back to repair things. It’s too late with a lot of them.

I guess the point if all this is I feel really alone right now. I think a lot of people do. Covid has put me in a weird situation where I really want to get out and meet people, but I can’t really. I just really wish I was close to someone right now. I feel like it would make it easier. 

I really hope the world gets better from the he’ll we are in right now. I hope the people in this subreddit find what they need and get better.

I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again....

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears.

Anxiety,o3o6wb,2021-06-20 01:13:29,"I'm not an antivaxxer! I believe in modern medicine. 

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay!

Anxiety,n9nzjp,2021-05-11 09:09:13,"I've spent most of the last 14 months inside, and my preexisting anxiety has gotten more intense. I've also had a previous anaphylactic reaction to a food allergy and most of my anxiety attacks have been regarding having a reaction to new foods or foods that are similar to what I know I am allergic to. Because of this, I have been extremely nervous about  getting vaccinated. I knew it was the right thing to do, and the way that the world gets better. I trust science and understand the facts that there's much more risk in long term Covid effects than negative effects from the vaccine. However, hearing allergic reactions to the vaccine being discussed and knowing that it's one of the issues they look out and prepare for has triggered my anxiety and made me afraid for when it was my turn.

I put it off much longer than I should have, but today I finally faced the fear and got through it. My experience was so positive. I found a local Buddhist university and knew that was the location I was meant to get it at. Everything went right, from the beginning. The parking attendant allowed us to pull right up and get the shot in our car even though the location recently went from drive through to walk up. The man taking my information heard about my allergies and got closer to me than I've been to another person in over a year and looked me right in the eyes and told me ""Hey, you're going to be alright."" He told me a story about why he is vulnerable and reassured me he was vaccinated and everything had gone smoothly for him and would for me as well. The nurse who stayed with me after was awesome and we spent the 30 minute wait talking about all the things I get to look forward to about entering the world again.

That gentleman looking me in the eyes and not just reassuring me, but in a way commanding me, to know I would be okay meant the world to me.

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could.

Anxiety,1ezdd4z,2024-08-23 19:24:24,"Something I don't believe is getting enough media attention is the psychological effects Post-Covid infection (the weeks after recovering/testing negative).

To preface, I have had mild anxiety most of my life but it was always manageable. I had never had a panic attack or any physical symptoms. 

However, after recovering from a Covid infection in January of this year (2024), I suddenly was experiencing a wave of physical anxiety symptoms. It started with extreme air hunger / shortness of breath which triggered my first panic attack ever in February. I didn't even comprehend it was a panic attack and was so convinced that something was wrong with my lungs and I had developed Asthma. After going to the hospital and running a bunch of tests including a Chest X-Ray, they told me it was a panic attack caused by anxiety and to talk to a Psychiatrist.

My therapist and psychiatrist suggested going on an SSRI but I didn't want to do that because of fear of the side effects (I'm very sensitive to medication) and the fact that my anxiety had always been so under control until this. I decided to do breathing exercises and other holistic methods to manage it and it gradually got better. 

Since then, I have had my moments with physical symptoms - random bouts of dizziness & derealization that last for a week or two. Or moments where I had chest tightness and air hunger / pressure in my head as if I'm on an Airplane. And I've only had two panic attacks since February. It sucks but I've been dealing with it as best I can without daily medication. Only the occasional 0.25 mg of Xanax when I'm feeling extra anxious.

Fast forward to now (August 2024), I just recovered from my second Covid infection of the year last week. And my anxiety has been worse than ever. I've had 3 Panic Attacks this week and have days where I'm just nonstop nervous / fluttering heart ALL DAY. It's been hell. I have taken Xanax more this week than ever in my life (just 3 times but still...). And talked to another Psychiatrist and he seems to think that there's definitely a connection between my intense anxiety symptoms and my Covid infections. 

I am trying to remain hopeful that these intense symptoms will subside in a few weeks time like last time but it's just scary cause it's been even more intense this time around. If not, my psychiatrist recommends trying propranolol or an SSRI which I of course don't want to do...

Anyone else experience more anxiety after recovering from Covid?

About a week or so later I started getting shortness of breath when not doing much at all.. but I could exercise and be fine.. then I had a panic attack. 

I’ve never experienced a panic attack before so this was a bit of a shock.

I found that walking helped and I lost nearly two stone in weight from not eating, being wired and walking loads as it seemed to give a temporary relief.

I paid for CBT privately over the following months which helped in gaining some reassurance initially and some of the techniques were useful. Especially the pursed lip breathing/facing the feelings and sitting with them/remembering that they are just sensations and are harmless

I spent more time out on my mountain bike/hiking doing relaxing activities that promote “mindfulness” and doing these activities for the right reasons and what I mean by that is being in the frame of mind to relax not to relieve the anxiety. This was a BIG mistake I made to start off with.. I was walking like a maniac etc because it gave me relief from the symptoms not necessarily because i wanted to.. turns out frame of mind matters when you’re attempting to soothe your out of whack nervous system!!

I really struggled to accept that it was anxiety due to the severe symptoms with seemingly no ‘mental’ component to it. Researching my symptoms just gave me zero clarity and if anything made me concerned that I had something more sinister. These now I can see as fairly typical traits of health anxiety which is a viscous circle to get stuck in.. 

Continued CBT through the NHS and that also was useful.

I’m fairly convinced that that Covid infection started these whole shenanigans BUT I do think that whatever started it/sent my body into a tailspin is kind of irrelevant now and really shouldn’t be the focus for anyone going through the same thing as it’s not helpful. The focus I should have had at the start was dealing with the result - the anxiety.

I feel that it’s been a teachable experience for me in the crazy symptoms your brain can give you. What’s worse is the links it makes.. you get a dry mouth maybe from not drinking enough or hot day something NORMAL and your mind goes DRY MOUTH? well last time you had a DRY MOUTH you had a panic attack maybe we should put everything into high alert and have a panic attack for good measure!!! Unbelievable.. and it’s hard to break those links to start with 

I’m now 9 months down the line and still my fight or flight is out of whack but it’s considerably better and I no longer get the shortness of breath, dizziness but still get the adrenaline feeling and some throat tightness but it’s less intense.

Anxiety,1k1zb2o,2025-04-18 13:10:09,"I’ve been experiencing persistent breathing issues since recovering from COVID-19 in 2022. Occasionally, I feel a mild but uncomfortable pain in my chest, which triggers anxiety as I worry about its cause. Alongside this, I sometimes struggle to breathe—it feels as though I can’t take air in. I’m not sure if this is related to anxiety, but my hands and legs often become cold, and I’m thrown into a state of confusion, nausea, and heightened anxiety. While I can manage these symptoms most of the time, there are moments when it becomes overwhelming, making me feel as though I might pass out.

My anxiety is fueled by concerns about potential complications from the COVID-19 vaccines, such as blood clots that could lead to heart attacks (HAs). My worry escalates when I experience pulsating pain in my thighs, which, according to my online research, might indicate deep vein thrombosis—again pointing to clots. This fear has intensified, and now even minor pains or twitches cause panic.

I’ve also noticed that, at times, small foggy mucus balls come out of my mouth. While this doesn’t happen consistently, I usually feel better after it happens.

I’ve wondered if my symptoms might be caused by digestive issues, though I doubt it since I’m 18 and eat a healthy diet. Blood tests I’ve undergone came back normal, except for a vitamin D deficiency—which, in my opinion, is common for people who spend most of their time indoors.

Recently, a doctor prescribed beta-blockers to address the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as cold and sweaty hands. I took the medication for a few days but stopped because I dislike taking medications, especially those that affect my heart. I’m unsure what steps to take next or which specialist to consult.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

Anxiety,1hre26h,2025-01-02 03:44:33,"Good evening,

I was at the beginning of a COVID infection and decided to drink some coffee. Normally, when I drink too much coffee, I get a bit anxious and alert, but it passes quite quickly. This time, however, it triggered a terrible panic attack, during which I felt like I was hearing voices (I'm not sure if I was actually hearing voices, I can't say for sure at this moment), telling me to harm members of my family.

I completely panicked and had two major panic attacks, feeling like I was losing my mind, and I was on the verge of calling the hospital to get myself admitted. I went to bed, and the next day, I was sicker than I had ever been. For three weeks, I was bedridden with an infection in my lungs, sinuses, bronchi, and throat, and extreme anxiety.

I refused to see my family out of fear of losing control of myself.

The illness lasted for three weeks, and the anxiety decreased day by day, but it still lingers.

For example, during all this time, I had the sensation of seeing ""things"" out of the corner of my eye, like a pile of clothes in my peripheral vision that I was sure was my cat, but it only appeared normally after a second glance.

I also had ""hallucinations"" that would appear for just a second in my vision and disappear instantly.

Since that episode, I feel like the chemistry in my brain has been disturbed. On some days, I can be at rock bottom, on the verge of tears, and later in the day, completely joyful, wanting to talk to everyone.

At first, I thought I was becoming schizophrenic, but now I feel like I might be bipolar.

For those who struggle with mental health issues like bipolar disorder, anxiety, etc., have you experienced similar symptoms to mine?

Also, for those who consumed coffee while infected with COVID, or just after a regular infection (I’ve heard of adrenal fatigue on another forum), have you experienced the same type of symptoms?

I really feel like I’m losing my mind, while before all of this, I had managed to stabilize my mental health (I’ve suffered from OCD and anxiety since a young age).

Thank you so much to those who will respond.

Anxiety,1gt3c65,2024-11-17 07:47:36,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share about myself and my Anxiety, and how it has gotten a lot worse in the post-covid world. I'm curious to get others opinions and suggestions.

Here's my story:

I am currently 28 years old. In High School, I developed very low self-esteem and became very addicted to computer games. My computer game addiction became so severe that during the summer between the end of Grade 10 and the beginning of Grade 11, I was on the computer basically all day and I remember how shortly before Grade 11 started, I looked in the mirror and said to myself, ""I want to die. I'll just see where life takes me.""

In Grade 11, the year started off bad, but there was a new student, a girl from Europe, and I fell madly in love with her. As a result of falling in love with her, I decreased my computer gaming and tried to spend more time on school work, with the idea of doing it 'for her', although I was too shy to talk to her. During the winter break, I completely quit computer games, and after winter break I felt absolutely amazing. I was killing it in all my classes after winter break, never getting a mark less than 90% on any assignment or test. I started studying a lot every single day, but I then started thinking a lot about how terrible it was how I used to be so addicted to computer games.

I forget exactly when, but I think in about April of that year, I had a mental breakdown, then severe depression. One weekend I decided to go to the movie theatre with my mother and brother in the hopes that it would help lift my depression. By the end of the movie, I actually felt like my depression magically went away, but a headache began.

This headache lasted for about two years (no exaggeration here). During the summer I was hospitalized and the team of doctors working on my case concluded that I didn't have a headache or migraine issue, but rather a mood issue. I was referred to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with Anxiety and ADHD. I took a one-year medical leave from school.

I still see this psychiatrist a few-couple times a year to this day. My best understanding is that I get this headache/migraine type pain from stress, but because it is based on my stress, it doesn't respond to medications that are designed to kill headaches/migraines. I have been taking an antidepressant medication daily since I started seeing the psychiatrist. The medication helps, but it doesn't solve my problems.

My fear/anxiety from technology and getting headaches from technology has continued to this day. I recently asked my psychiatrist if I have a phobia of technology, and he gave the somewhat vague answer, ""you convinced yourself that technology was the source of your problems.""

I avoid screens and audio from technology as much as possible. When I am on the TTC, I find a place to stand or sit where there are no screens in my field of vision. I often wear a hood to reduce my field of vision in this regard. If I am in a subway car and someone is playing audio on their phone, I switch subway cars as fast as possible. If I am on a bus and someone is playing audio, I put on my earplugs or plug my ears with my fingers. When someone walks by me on their phone, I usually turn my head or at least my eyes away so that I don't see their phone screen. All of these situations and my behaviour/reactions cause me stress, which contributes to my ""tendency to get headaches, which is worsened by your anxiety"" as my psychiatrist describes my headaches.

I get these headaches (I call them headaches, although technically they may not be headaches) a lot. The severity, frequency and duration varies a lot. There are time periods where I have a headache for more than a month straight, and there have been time periods where I didn't get a single headache for a whole month. Lately I have been getting them almost every day. When I get the headaches, I often also get facial muscle spasms on the right side of my face, including my right ear twitching. I am capable of twitching my right ear regardless of whether or not I am having a headache, which a neurologist told me is not normal. The right ear twitching makes my facial muscles spasm.

I also have a nervous tic on my right leg that makes my right leg shake when I am sitting. I also have tapering fingers (my hands shake). As well, I get throbbing pain in my legs when I am sitting down or lying down, although this throbbing pain doesn't bother me much. It's interesting how all these things happen mostly on the right side of my body. My understanding is I get all of this because of my stress/anxiety.

I recently quit my job as a Legal Assistant (it is worth noting that I have been able to work on a computer, despite my anxiety/fear, but I got headaches/migraines a lot during the time I was working as a Legal Assistant, which is mainly why I quit my job). I am back in college now for teaching.

I have no idea what my future is going to be like. The post-covid world is more technology-centered than the world has ever been before, and I hate it and fear it. I want a job/career that doesn't involve using technology much, and that doesn't involve working in a place where there is music playing. This ideal is becoming harder and harder with everything becoming more technology-based. Perhaps I may end up as a construction worker, but I know I am truly capable of doing a lot better than that. My anxiety has been through the roof lately.

That's my story. I haven't included all details as I didn't want to make it too long. Please let me know what thoughts you may have and what suggestions you may have. One thing I have been practicing lately is saying to myself, ""relax, don't care"" when for example there is a screen in my field of vision, or I am walking by someone on their phone, or there is music playing. But I'm not sure if this has really been helpful, as it also reminds me of my anxiety. What I find best is completely distracting/absorbing myself in something, like playing chess with friends, but I can only do this occasionally, it is easier said than done, and I can't do it when I have a bad headache.

Anxiety,1gw7the,2024-11-21 09:53:27,"I've been feeling nothing sort of anxious and confused about my existence, and I think I figured out the reason, but not a solution. I want to see if I'm the only individual who feels this way. 

I'm 32 (M), I already have enough anxiety about that alone but that's a different post. When Covid first reared it's head, I was 28. As many of you no doubt also experienced, I was sent home, everything shut down, masks came on, we couldn't go out, and it felt like the world stopped dead. 

During 2020-2022, and even into 2023 a bit, my life did not move forward at all. I was never unemployed, which I'm thankful for, but nothing really moved ahead. No new friendships, no dates, no relationships, no trips, no real career advancement, no change to housing, etc. Fast track to 2024, and I feel like the last 3-4 years was a complete blur and I have to remind myself it even happened. In 2019, my life was socializing with friends, working my way up the ladder at work, going on dates (none ever panned out but still), and just enjoying life. 

Fast track to 2024. All of sudden, my social life does not exist, everyone is married, all my friends bought houses, and I haven't worked in an office since and I work fully remotely; albeit at a different employer. 

Did I lose 4 years of my life? I can't seem to grasp that I aged 4 years since everything was turned on its side. I was reminded today that I'll be 33 in 6 months, and that seems so foreign to me. Like how? I'm 32 and I haven't even been on a date in 4 years, but I never even thought about it. I'm almost 7 years to 40 and I feel like I should be turning 30 next year. Its like I conceptually don't understand that I've aged 4 years, I feel out of place, like I've lapsed or switched universes or something. Like shit im supposed to own a home and have a family right now, right? I also realized that I really have almost no recollection of events DURING covid aside from a few scattered images. It's like a blank spot in my brain. 

I was invited to a birthday outing this weekend for a fellow member of my fencing club. I had always assumed they were right around my age. Then I found its 26th bday. Like wait, am I too old to attend this? I'm not the oldest person going but still this just seems off to me. I'm 32? What?

If I had to give it an analogy, it feels like I watched season 1 of a TV show and then skipped to season 3 not realizing I missed a season, but just accepted it and kept going. 

The change from 20s to 30s is a transformative time for most even during normal times, did covid just exacerbate it? I don't know, but I can't get a foothold on it and it's making me lose sleep. 

Can anyone weigh in on this? It's driving me crazy and I feel constant angst.

I felt good for the first half of September but had a major depressive/anxiety episode at the end of the month.

Anxiety,1fd1rh6,2024-09-10 03:27:49,"Simply just need some words of encouragement and some interaction.. last night I had the worst panic attack of my life and I think it's because I've been quarantined for the past week and have had no human interaction. 

I've been really sick with COVID and yesterday I was really not feeling it and definitely going stir crazy. Long story short I was restless and couldn't stop my thoughts for hours and my heart started racing and went to the hospital. I was severely dehydrated and once I got fluids and calm people to calm me down I was fine. 

I think the dehydration sent my body into fight or flight mode which makes a lot of sense but the anxiety part is still a bit scary. My heart was racing at about 130-135bpm for at least 25 minutes until I called EMS. 

I never knew that I could get anxiety for the exact opposite reason than what used to send me into panic attacks in high school. Needing human interaction is essential so is water apparently lol but with COVID it's very hard to keep hydrated especially for me. 

This is my last semester in college, second week in and I got COVID so that's already stressful enough among so many other factors right now.

This especially relates to my heart where easily led to worst case scenario thinking. I had overcome it with a combination of therapy, intense exercise (basically exposure therapy), and medication in the form of buspar. 

However flash forward to a month ago. I came down with COVID for the second time since 2020, I was vaccinated and boosted twice, and had an awful time. High fever, cough, and body aches but the most difficult was my anxiety. This was related to the fact that while I had COVID, probably due to my fever, my heart rate was consistently elevated. After a week I was testing negative and all of my symptoms went away expect the anxiety. In fact the anxiety began increasing and is now back to levels from years ago. I am obsessively checking my heart rate, having daily panic attacks, and am unable to exercise due to fear. 

So what is going on? Am I experiencing long COVID and just need to continue to heal, or did COVID re-trigger my previous anxiety. Has anyone else had anxiety or panic disorder after having COVID?

Anxiety,1flvl8t,2024-09-21 10:37:41,"Hello, I started experiencing Covid symptoms Wednesday. My family has it and now I've caught it. No fever. But I'm super dizzy, chest pain, cough, throat burns, headache from coughing, body aches. I've been drinking and resting plenty. I'm super scared about the dizziness and don't see it listed as a covid symptom really. I have a pulseoximeter and my oxygen is fine. My blood pressure is also fine. I've checked it laying, sitting, and standing. 
A little back story, we caught the flu at the end of January this year, and my fiancé passed out several times which freaked me out super super bad. His ended up being from dehydration and low blood pressure from being sick. I couldn't sleep for weeks, had nightmares, panic attacks, was constantly worried about him getting up for a couple of months. And I was dizzy from the flu, but it never went away fully. I think maybe because of my high anxiety? Not sure. But it was manageable.  Then in the middle of June-ish I was in Walmart and felt like I was gonna pass out, body went numb, heart racing, I think it was a panic attack but it freaked me out. Around that time my fiancé cut his hand open, and I again freaked out thinking he cut his finger off, was gonna pass out again, etc. and I've been dizzy every since then. I've been to the hospital and they did blood work, ekg, and said it's probably just my anxiety. The feeling of me being dizzy and feeling like im gonna pass out consumes me. Im constantly checking my blood pressure, convinced it's dropping. I can't leave the house anymore. I think maybe this is because of what happened to my fiancé in January? I don't really know. But, this dizziness I've had while having Covid is miserable. And of course, my brain has convinced me there's something wrong, im dying, it'll never stop. Has anybody had dizziness this bad from either Covid or anxiety? And im not talking dizzy spells, it's constant.

Anxiety,1f6rn29,2024-09-02 04:25:50,"Back towards mid July I got hit with bad anxiety/depression like I was having post partum all over again out of no where. This all came about after having 1 mixed alcoholic drink. Felt like I got roofied and had anxiety for almost 2 weeks.

After bloodwork and explained to my doctor some symptoms I was having.. I found out I have insulin resistance & PCOS. 
During this time I also stopped taking Prozac cold turkey (bad idea, I know). I went through withdrawal and got back on my old anxiety medication, Citalopram. 
I was on Citalopram for a long long time since a young adult (I’m now 31) and it helped me tremendously. The only reason I switched to Prozac back in February was because i thought maybe Citalopram wasn’t working anymore but in hindsight, it was my PCOS symptoms and I didn’t realize at the time because I wasn’t diagnosed. 
Once things balanced out and I got through withdrawal I felt better for about 3 weeks then boom, I get COVID and all its fun symptoms.
Day 3 of bad Covid symptoms, my anxiety comes back again full force.
Today I am feeling a little better from the Covid symptoms but still having Anxiety. (Day 5)
I was so close to admitting myself to the hospital because of having a mental breakdown.
I am PRAYING this goes away. Going to ask my PCP if she will increase my Citalopram to see if that could help.

Illness didn’t seem severe and lasted about 4 days at most severe point, was eating and not feeling anxious while sick. Moderate anxiety history (mostly in school or extracurriculars when presenting or performing for a crowd) but no panic attack history, social anxiety history, or medical anxiety. Typically an outgoing person, working in sales/property management and regularly drove fine. Since the 4th or so day infected to now I have had probably 10 panic attacks with 1 that took me to ER. All tests seemed clear, and was diagnosed with anxiety/prescribed hydroxyzine in the event another occurs. Seems the panic has escalated since the ER visit however and in the course of 2 weeks went from working full time to complete fear to leave the house as likely will have a panic attack in public. The last severe one I had was this last Monday where I was trying to drive and couldn’t because of the symptoms - trouble breathing, feeling overly hot, tingly/numb hands and feet, severe neck pain, short breath and racing heart (overall panic state very hard to get out of even with coping taught by therapist). It felt like I needed to be hospitalized again but 1.5 weeks prior was told I was seemingly ok and experiencing anxiety. Seeking additional therapy (1st appt was 1 week ago) and alternate medication because hydroxyzine prescribed gave severe side effects of dizziness and dry mouth and didn’t soothe breathing which seemed to heighten panic attacks. I typically use marijuana and caffeine but since the initial attack they both seem to heighten symptoms so I have gone cold Turkey but truly do not feel much an effect without these, no withdrawals, I just feel confused why there’s such a great effect now when for so many years used with no issue. Thought cutting them would stop panic but it hasn’t which is frustrating.

Anxiety,1erct4o,2024-08-13 22:17:05,"Posted this in a covid related sub too.

Tested positive for COVID yesterday, and last night I had trouble sleeping and formed some random mild anxiety that has been on/off all night and in to today.  I do not have any known prior anxiety, panic attacks, depression, etc disorders.  I woke up around 1am, realized I was still congested and mouth was dry/hurting a bit, then the anxiety kicked in.  Spent several hours pacing, trying to sleep in bed and the recliner, at one point I jolted awake a few times in a row within a span of 5-10 minutes to take a breath. Eventually fell asleep in the recliner from around 5 to 8 am.

The anxiety did not go away, it's very mild, but enough to bother me and generate more worrying.  Have an appt with my PCP in a few hours about the COVID symptoms, but mainly just concerned about the anxiety and I doubt they'll be able to do anything about it, and I defintely don't just want to 'deal with it'.  No idea what I'm even anxious about, I've had COVID before and it doesn't alarm me, nor do the other symptoms since I kind of deal with them all the time anyway.

My wife and I are convinced I have sleep apnea, maybe it's my body telling me to finally get that looked at?

I guess I'm just seeing if anxiety is a new/known symptom of covid these days, and if I should press my doctor to refer me to someone for it.  I probably sound like a huge baby considering it's not that bad, but as someone that doesn't normally deal with anxiety, it's rather discomforting especially if it's going to be causing insomnia.",posted covid related sub tested positive covid yesterday last night trouble sleeping formed random mild anxiety night today known prior anxiety panic attacks depression etc disorders woke around 1am realized still congested mouth bit anxiety kicked spent several hours pacing trying sleep bed recliner one point jolted awake times row within span minutes take breath eventually fell asleep recliner around 5 8 anxiety go away mild enough bother generate worrying appt pcp hours covid symptoms mainly concerned anxiety doubt able anything defintely want idea even anxious covid alarm symptoms since kind deal time anyway wife convinced sleep apnea maybe body telling finally get looked guess seeing anxiety symptom covid days press doctor refer someone probably sound like huge baby considering bad someone normally deal anxiety rather discomforting especially going causing insomnia

I’m currently at Disney world and I have no way home or out of my hotel that I’m sharing with my grandparents and brother. My grandpa has symptoms of COVID and even though he hasn’t tested positive or negative yet, my head is hurting from all the spiraling thoughts. My birthday is in 10 days and my first day of school is in 8. So If I get COVID, I’m down for both of them. I have symptoms (stuffy nose) and I’m too scared to tell anyone and idk what to do. I’m going to be viewed as selfish or ignorant no matter what I do or say because I’m anxious about it rather than being empathetic that my grandpa is sick at Disney. I’m going to have a panic attack if I don’t get this under control. I don’t know what to do. I hate Disney. I hate it. With one positive experience, comes ten negative ones. I miss my home.

I said I’d never do them again because they literally show me such a calm beautiful side of life that I know is too good to be true. Being normal and chill is too good to be true.

I have become very covid conscious in the past year or so, but I haven’t really been able to show it. I have ocd, social anxiety, and other mental health issues. I live with my parents.  I never get a chance to wear a mask without being comfortable to do so with/in front of my parents or in public without being embarrassed. My parents never cared about covid or long covid, so I can’t see myself asking them to get me a mask or having a conversation with them about wearing masks. I can’t convince them to let me wear masks because they don’t believe in whatever I talk to them about on the internet, for example, long covid, unless they have seen or heard about it themselves. I have been thinking about wearing a mask when I have more independence, such as when I get old enough to drive or when I go to college.

I’m also looking for free masks without giving out my address. Keep in mind that I can’t drive yet.

I’m also afraid that if I do decide to wear masks when I get a bit older, I might not have any friends, which could lead to other mental health issues.

Please leave some advice or tips for what I should do based on my situation.

Anxiety,17wf5vd,2023-11-16 11:01:33,"Hey fellow anxious people 

I had covid Feb 2021. I feel like that around the time this started happening. 

I will be asleep and my heart is pounding so fast and hard it wakes me up out of my sleep. I try and try but cannot get my heart to calm down. This happens multiple times a week.

I’ve seen my gp who ran normal blood tests and nothing came back. I’ve seen my psych who obviously said it’s anxiety (which I do have, and have had panic attacks for most of my life, but they always happen when I’m awake so this doesn’t make sense) and we tried every medication under the sun for anxiety. Nothing prevents it, though we did find a medication that drastically reduced my generalized anxiety. 

I had a sleep study because I swore I it was from sleep apnea, that could be the only explanation, that I stopped breathing at night. 

Sleep study came back totally normal. One of the best sleepers he’s seen. He did note he saw heart palpitations in the beginning of the night (when I normally experience it) and he said it was likely due to…. You guessed it, anxiety. 

Now it’s still happening. The only thing my dr will try is giving me diff doses of propranolol. Which gives me anxiety in itself because I feel like my heart is going to stop. 

Anyways. Wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone has dealt with something similar. I feel like it’s related to covid. My sense of smell never fully came back. Maybe we just don’t understand the full impact on our bodies.

Anxiety,1d56pfc,2024-06-01 02:58:06,"This isn't a diagnosis question. Just me venting about something triggering that happened today. 

I'm panicking. So yesterday I had bad vertigo and my hand was tingling. I decided to not take any chances and go to the ER to get checked out. My mom drove me and so when I get there I'm in the room where they take you vitals. The one nurse was coughing and sniffling. Her voice sounded like she was sick. Now I was wearing a mask and she was wearing a mask though later I noticed she lowered the mask to speak to someone. I started worrying because I'm currently morbidly obese. Now I did get the first vaccine 2 years ago but then afterwards I got covid. My doctor said I didn't have to get any second shot for a while. I didn't realize so much time has passed though and so it's been two years since I had a vaccine or covid. I want to stress I AM NOT AN ANTIVAXER. I just have terrible time perception and with my OCD, anxiety and autism I tend to zone out a lot and assume not much time has passed. I did get this weird sickness in January I think where I had no symptoms except I lost my voice but I took like 4 at home tests all were negative so I'm not sure if it was covid or not. I'm panicking because I don't know if that one shit and infection from 2 years ago would be enough for my body to remember how to fight the virus 😭😭 my mom even asked the nurse while I was being checked by the doctor if she had covid and she said no so I want to believe her and assume she probably has a cold or the flu or allergies but my anxiety keeps telling me any day now I'll get sick and end up hospitalized 😭😭

Head pressure on and off
Brain fog/ derealisation 
Shortness of breath and chest pressure on and off 
PEM ( post exertional malaise) ME/CFS

I wanted to ask if you can have anxiety manifest in this way rather than begin mentally anxious? 

I’m literally going to lose my mind soon cause I can’t live like this, I don’t know if this is purely anxiety or maybe coming from the same system as people that have anxiety without long Covid etc. 

I’m thinking of starting a SSRI as I know they can calm down the CNS and some are anti inflammatory. 

Can anyone give any advice? Do these symptoms sound like anxiety disorder?

Anxiety,1dbqubl,2024-06-09 16:09:33,"So, I have suffered with light migraine attacks & anxiety attacjs in my life, they last for a short period of time and were tolerable.

After COVID (as well as the vaccine & two boosters), I started getting severe crippling vestibular migraine symptoms, got put on Botox, nerve block, Emgality, as well as acute meds such as Ubrelvy and Triptans, and motion sickness meds for the vestibular symptoms during a flare up. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is more severe than ever.

I consider myself to be well oriented scientifically, not much of a conspiracy theorist but I understand how undermined covid is in the pub education (probably to not scare people) and how overestimated the level of safety we know about the vaccines. Everything flared up after covid, I met the criteria of diagnosis for the following: chronic vestibular migraine, ulcerative colitis, GERD, Bile Reflux, generalized anxiety disorder.

On a bunch of meds.. now this could be just a correlation, or maybr covid only triggered the pre-dispositioned genes (basically it might have sped up what was bound to happen). But oh my God. Yes meds do help a lot. Thank God (and pharma) for the meds that help us.. but at the same time you just start thinking.. why everything went sideways in a short period of time.

Anxiety,1cols1z,2024-05-10 15:24:02,"Anyone else experience this?

Ever since I had covid a year and a half ago I have been getting weird panic attacks and palpitations now and then. They were first really severe two weeks after my symptoms ,  my heart would beat fast every time I stood up or walked up hill. Which resolved itself in 6weeks.

During this time I would go to bed and then have this sinking feeling in chest that would make my head and hands sweat or have pins and needles, I would be freaking out and feel on edge for hours after. Like needing to distract myself when sitting still and just anticipating the next ‘attack’. I would hold my chest tight or sleep on my chest as a way to ‘protect it’ and I would find myself having to take deep breaths to relax. I would also feel dizzy and weird but it would only last up to two seconds.


As time went on I spent most of 2023 not having any symptoms, apart from a few attacks here and there. The last two months I started taking sertraline which has been an enormous help but now and then I still start seem to have these weird palpitations

Basically me heart would beat normally, then after 4-5 beats it would  have a pause, and then after the pause, beat a little bit harder (but not all the time) anyway, once this ‘pause’ begins I get this rush to my chest/ sinking feeling/feeling of doom and I would get a  sudden rush to my hands and sometimes feet, usually accompanied by a tingling sensation. I would also sweat a bit on my forehead. This would last for about 10-20 min then I would be ok. But during this my chest will feel fluttery and like it’s on the edge of another palpitation  and I will feel quite uncomfortable.

It happens more when I start feeling my pulse, like my brain is anticipating it and it occurs more frequently.  If not then it seems to mainly occur when I’m in bed looking at my phone just before I sleep. I can literally spend the whole day feeling fine then it happens.  

thing is, I am a runner and ultra marathoner and have been running for a decade. I’m 30 now but when I was 22-24 I had extensive tests done on my heart. I have an abnormal rhythm, but nothing was diagnosed. I run thousands of miles a year with no issues most of the time and my resting HR is usually 35-45 BMP.  I had an ecg and blood tests after covid and it looked normal. Three doctors told me it seemed to be anxiety related. 

I recently started taking sertraline the last two months and it's been a big help. Although my HR has got very low- down to 30 overnight, so I am a little bit worried it may be causing this, but it’s not the first time I have experienced this, and even when I was younger my HR would get to 35 ish. Also some of my runs recently have felt the best in like 4-5 years, nice and relaxed and little effort.

But it’s only in the last 5 years that my body goes into fight or flight mode anytime I overeat, feel bloated, eat the wrong thing, feel gassy, or need to make a BM. 

I described these symptoms to my brother and his are exactly the same. And his are also recent, in the last 5 years. 

It’s almost like my body has forgotten how to process normal digestive functions. 

If I eat too much, my body panics before I feel bloated. Like there’s an inflated balloon in my chest making it hard to breathe or swallow. 

I know if I can just belch, I’ll feel better. But why is my body in fight or flight? Same thing happens if I need to poop. All of a sudden, my heart starts pounding, it gets hard to breathe, I get sudden hot flashes. Sometimes I get light-headed. And then about 5 minutes later, I’ll feel the need to poop. 

It’s funny, but it’s not. Has my body forgotten how to process normal bodily functions? And the only reason I ask if it’s Covid related is because it’s literally been the last 5 years or so. And same for my brother.

I asked why they didn't try to get someone to come in for her shift this morning, and she said she didn't think it was that serious.

Later in the afternoon after she had left, another coworker commented that I was being extra quiet. I responded to her saying I was a bit anxious because of the whole deal with our other coworker. She said ""oh it's no big deal, my roommate and his girlfriend have been sick and couldn't smell anything, etc. and that was like a week ago and I'm still feeling fine!"" She said they never even got tested. I asked her if she knew that she could just be asymptomatic and still spreading the virus around, and she told me she didn't think that was the case because she never felt sick.

I hate having to choose between doing what I know is right and going into work because I can't survive without income, and now I'm just terrified of getting sick from covid or anything else because I don't want my boss to be angry with me.

I would like to go off the meds some day, so I'm hoping someone out there has some advice for me to actually heal.

I know things like this can be very complicated, but I'll try to just give the essential details.  I'm 39 years old.  I'm married and have a 6 year old son.  I've been a gamer since I was little and it has been my main hobby.  My son only has 1 grandparent left, so I've had to deal with a fair bit of loss since around 2013.  I had some similar nauseous anxiety for a week right when my son was born.  I think because the change was making me so emotional and freaking me out that I was becoming responsible for a life.  It went away though and I mostly felt fine for years, though there was definitely some anxiety here and there which kind of goes along with being a parent.  You know, feeling like I'm going to snap in the night because my son was waking up for the 5th time and all I wanted to do was get some rest.  Pretty normal though!

Anyway, I got Covid in 2021 and it's like my consciousness, awareness, and view of life shifted into something else... along with permanent fear and dread.  I think I got a panic attack part way through having Covid, and then it just seems like it never ended.  I was even optimistic after the first couple days because I only really had a fever and headache.  I thought I was getting off easy.  Then the nausea started.  I can't be sure if it was directly from the Covid, or if it was from my nerves.  I definitely worried about dying because there were stories about people suffocating in the night.  Maybe that's all it took.  I was nauseous, having diarrhea, and in a constant state of fear and panic for a month until I finally started an antidepressant.  It helped some for a bit, but after a while it didn't seem to do much.

Well, over that month and for months after I basically worried about everything and questioned everything.  The anxiety seemed to be making me search myself for a cause so I could resolve it... maybe it's just that fear of death isn't something that can really be solved.  Anyway, I worry about my son being lonely, life being too much for me to handle, whether or not I'm 'living the right way', my wife being lonely, what is worth doing, what the point is of anything if we die, afraid of aging, afraid of future loss... losing my wife... everything is temporary.  It's like I was delusional and thought everything was permanent, even though I intellectually knew of death and had thought about it numerous times.  Then I suddenly found out everything is transient and I really am going to die and lose everything one day.

Is this just an existential crisis and I need time to heal?  Is this a spiritual awakening?  Did Covid directly affect my body and mess up my nervous system?  How do I accept change, responsibility, and the fact that one day I will die?  Everything just feels so critical.

Well, that's most of it.  Just looking for some kind of feedback for a direction to go on acceptance or ways to be to get back to being okay.

Anxiety,18rpsz4,2023-12-27 08:19:01,"Hi every one!

I'm a 38 year old woman and I'm experiencing sinus tachycardia for almost 3 months now. I don't have it every day, but when it starts, it lasts several hours, up to two full days. When I have tachicardia, my resting heart rate is between 90-130 per minute. 

I had blood tests done, including checking for the thyroid, two electrocardiograms, and an echocardiogram. Everything seems to be normal, apart from the tachycardia obviously. Even my blood pressure is fine. 

Two years ago I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. I took Prozac for eight months and have been doing well since then. I have not been feeling anxious, I have not had any panic attacks.

Two of the doctors I've seen told be that I should work on my anxiety, although my psychiatrist and therapist agreed that anxiety is not the issue. Two other doctors prescribed me (different) betablockers.

However, the last doctor I saw suggested that my symptoms might be due to long COVID. The thing is I'm not even sure I had COVID recently. Two weeks before the tachycardia started, I had a fever for two days, and a headache, but no cough. I didn't think it was COVID. Other than the tachycardia, I have no other long COVID symptoms either.

Tachycardia is exhausting . I can not exercise. It's interfering with my work, I can not even enjoy a quiet evening at home. I'm at my wit's end

I got the most recent strain right at the start of the wave, about a week before Christmas. I had pretty typical symptoms, took paxlovid, thought it was mostly done. Then I had a difficult conversation with a loved one, and my anxiety response was WAYYYY out of proportion. Couldn’t eat for days, stopped getting any deep sleep, constantly felt completely gripped by physical anxiety. 

I thought this was just living with anxiety, and probably related to my chronic health issues. But then my PCP told me she had to give some of her patients short term disability leave because their ongoing COVID symptoms that exactly matched my anxiety symptoms. I’ve since seen various articles confirming it, so it’s not just a coincidence. 

If you’ve been experiencing anything like this without an explanation in the last month or two, this may be a reason. If so, it should naturally alleviate on its own for most people.

Anxiety,pq0ggy,2021-09-17 19:16:00,"Thank you to everyone who reached out to me on my previous post here! Your kindness and reassurance was so helpful and extremely appreciated! 

I went and got the COVID vaccine yesterday, and you guys were right. The anticipation anxiety was much worst than the experience itself.
 I have a phobia of needles, and a bunch of other irrational fears and anxieties over all of this. 
So this took a lot out of me. 
I did have a mini panic attack afterwards when they told me to wait 10 mins, I got really hot and sweaty but I managed to tell myself “this is NOT an allergic reaction, or anything like that. This is your anxiety trying to tell you to think it is. This is a symptom of anxiety itself and nothing more” and it went away immediately. 
Normally, I’d panic harder thinking physical symptoms aren’t related to my anxiety. 
You have to remind yourself the physical things your body can do when you’re having anxiety, anxiety attacks, and panic attacks.
I’ve had these feelings before with taking an unknown medication, or anything new like this. I just internally panic and idk why. 

I am trying to be stronger than who my anxiety is making me out to be. I often look back at the times I worried myself physically sick, and had massive anticipation anxiety over something, and probably 9.9 times out of 10 there was NOTHING to worry about. It was all fine. And in the case the thing that I was worried about did happen, it was less severe than it was to be worrying about it. 
I’m trying to remind myself of this! 
Anxiety is not helping me! It’s usually not warning me of something dangerous! It’s overworked because it’s part of my mental illness. But we can learn to overcome it and manage it, and hopefully be stronger than we ever were. 

Thank you again to everyone helping me through my anxiety of getting vaccinated. 
I’m so happy I finally did this, and I am sorry I didn’t do this sooner. 
It’s the next day for me and so far, I experienced just a sore arm and fatigue. I am aware that side effects could still happen, but I’m also reminding myself that it may not, and that if it does it’ll all be okay. 
I’m telling my anxiety to not overreact and anticipate the worst, as it usually does. What is done is done.

I’m also going to take a break from reading the scary parts of the internet. I know I should be smarter to know not to fall victim to that stuff, but they still scare me. And scaring me is not going to benefit me right now. 
I hate that the world is so against each other right now. It honestly breaks my heart to just simply be on the internet sometimes. 

Thank you so much to everyone here. You guys made me cry happy tears to just see such a supportive caring side of the internet. 
You guys helped me step into what I feel is the right direction. 
Thank you thank you thank you!!! 

TLDR: with the help of everyone’s support here, I finally faced my fears of needles, and other related anxieties of getting the vaccine. 
I revered my vaccine yesterday and so far everything went completely fine. Despite my anxiety telling me it wouldn’t.

Anxiety,s15zc7,2022-01-11 11:38:46,"I've had anxiety about covid for a very long time. I was always worried that if I got it the worst possible outcome would happen. I have a friend that died after finding out he had it. I also know several other people that have had it and it only lasted a few days and they were fine.

I can't help but worry though. I have high blood pressure, and I don't sleep very well. In all likelihood, given I'm vaccinated (but wasn't boosted yet unfortunately, kicking myself for not going sooner) I'll be all right. But it's really hard to not spiral. It's hard to tell if the chest pains are from anxiety or covid. My heart rate hasn't gone down all day. I'm exhausted and can't sleep but I need to sleep. I'd like to flash forward a few weeks when everything will be okay because that's what I want it to be. Statistically speaking, that will be the exact outcome. And I need to focus on me being fine and I just need to ride it out. 

Get vaccinated. Get boosted. This sucks, and I'm scared. But things will be alright. Because one, I want them to be. And two, I don't turn 30 for a few months and I'm in a very good category for things to be fine. I take medication for my blood pressure, but I'm also overweight and haven't exercised very much in the last year. On the plus side, I've lost 65 pounds from my heaviest. That being said, I still can't help but worry and be anxious. I have been working on techniques to help my anxiety. I've scheduled everything I can possibly do, but the dates are so far out because of the overwhelmed medical system right now. And now I have to wait because I have covid.

But these symptoms still persist and I can’t get it out of my head that they will just get worse and worse. Or that somehow something was missed and I’m suddenly going to drop dead from sudden cardiac arrest or a severe heart attack. A lot of the most recent studies coming out about covid are scary as shit - rates of young folks dying young of cardiovascular problems and strokes on the up, rises in cancer rates, accumulating damage with each Covid infection you get, Long Covid. It all feels way too overwhelming and it feels like the only way to avoid it is to stop doing the things that make my life worth living. I’m currently seeing a therapist and my doctor has signed me off work for three weeks. there are for sure better and worse days but I still feel so lost and terrified. It’s occupying most of my waking thoughts - and I’m just thinking about how all this stress from this is MORE likely to make a heart attack happen too.

Anxiety,125twvj,2023-03-29 22:32:02,"So I really lost at this point.

What symptoms I have is:
Anxiety, Head fullness, occasionally headaches, tiredness through the day, bad dreams, ear ringing and really bad brain fog that makes me hard to concentrate, think and be present. Also some kind of lightheaded feeling. In that state I can't really enjoy anything. Walking outside not fixing it.

Also I can get random chills feeling. Even if it's warm in the room and anyone else want to open the window. Body temperature is normal tho.

I don't have crazy BPM, don't have full blown panic attacks. My BPM is normal even in hardest times.

All this symptoms last days, after that I can have some good days where almost none of that symptoms is here. Then, out of the blue they coming back.

Is this state can be from anxiety only? Cause I'm not sure anymore so I have this long-lasting COVID consequences or just bouts of health anxiety.

I want to go back on Zoloft, but hesitate about it.

Suggestions for reducing anxiety:

1. Periodically take some time to stop and get some fresh air. If allowed, go outside and take a short walk. Otherwise consider at least opening a window and take a few deep breaths.
2. Limit the amount of time you spend looking at the news. For example, you can set two concrete times such as 30 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes in the evening to read the news. The rest of the day, stay off of it. No good will come from monitoring the latest news posts in real time constantly.
3. Consider reducing the time spent on social media. You don’t necessarily need to quit altogether, but at least save a large portion of the day to do other things. The goal is to frequently clear your headspace of all news, all thoughts, all external talk. This will refocus your mind on just what is going on at the present moment, meaning you can begin to deal with things one thing at a time rather than all at once. For extra help with this, check out the mindfulness meditation video under the helpful links section.
4. With all the misinformation out there right now, one way to combat it is to only use a few select sources for your news. As an example, you could use the CDC, WHO, NHS, John Hopkins University and then one or two local news stations and exclude the rest.
5. Be careful not to fall into a vicious cycle of reassurance-seeking with regards to health anxiety. Anxiety can cause a huge number of physical symptoms, and they will tend to line up with whatever illness you happen to be worried about (coronavirus in this case). Each time you Google a symptom or come here to ask for reassurance, you are confirming that the anxiety was somehow valid. You’ll feel relief for a moment, but it’ll come back soon enough, and you’ll be back to Googling/looking for reassurance. One way to combat this is to keep a daily tally on paper of how many times you sought reassurance from somewhere, with the goal of reducing the total each day.

Anxiety,14acx54,2023-06-16 02:16:30,"Hi all,

Long story short I ended up in the ER this past weekend from horrible panic attacks and anxiety that wouldn’t quit. The doctor thought I may have had a bad reaction to the antivirals I took to mitigate covid (I have a chronic illness so the antivirals were recommended). It turns out that Paxlovid can have a pretty significant impact on mood. The more I read, the most I see that covid itself has had negative impacts on a lot of people’s mental health post infection as well. 

I am prone to anxiety but generally don’t have a a bad case of it, nor do I panic very often. So this was the last two weeks from hell and the ER doctor prescribed me 1mg Ativan. It’s been a lifesaver, to say the least. Still navigating covid symptoms but at least am not feeling like a basket case while doing so.

I’m wondering if anyone else had to go this route and how long you took the Ativan for. I know addiction and withdrawal are something to look out for but if I end up needing this for a few more weeks will that be okay?",hi long story short ended er past weekend horrible panic attacks anxiety quit doctor thought may bad reaction antivirals took mitigate covid chronic illness antivirals recommended turns paxlovid pretty significant impact mood read see covid negative impacts lot people mental health post infection well prone anxiety generally bad case panic often last two weeks hell er doctor prescribed 1mg ativan lifesaver say least still navigating covid symptoms least feeling like basket case wondering anyone else go route long took ativan know addiction withdrawal something look end needing weeks okay

I’m doing the trip with a company (EF Ultimate Break).

My mom, aunt, uncle and I are supposed to go to the State Fair later today, but that’s where I think I got Covid last year. I really don’t want to get Covid while I’m abroad, because then I’ll miss out on something I might not be able to do again for years and I won’t be around anyone I know. I think in the EU, it’s a 7 day mandatory isolation if I test positive, which means pretty much of the meat of my trip.

Anxiety,1fuvik4,2024-10-03 06:09:38,"Why the fuck am I chronically dizzy like that? It started in 2019 when I learned I was about to be a father. I became extremely stressed out and suddenly became dizzy one evening and it sent me into a health anxiety tailspin that lasted like 6 months. Dizziness stopped after about 10 weeks once I was reassured by a clear brain MRI.

Fast forward March 2024 I got dizzy again from a sudden head movement and of course immediately freaked out thinking ""It’s gonna last months again like 2019!"" and lo and behold it did. I was constantly monitoring for the dizziness and panicked and had another brain MRI: clear again. Then had an inner ear MRI: clear. Diagnosis was basically dizziness from anxiety. Lasted 10 weeks and went away from one day to the next when I became fixated on another health issue…

Now September 2 there was a party at my house and I got very anxious and dizziness hit me. Once again like a fucking idiot I started panicking and thinking ""Oh no it’s gonna last months again!!!"" and it hasn’t quit since.

My dizziness isn’t room spinning it’s the inside of my head that feels like it’s spinning. It’s worse when I’m upright and walking, I feel like I’m a bobble head. I also get feelings of pressure in my head and pretty bad derealization like my vision can’t keep up with my head movements and I feel like I see everything through a window like in a dream state. I feel like I’m high or severely jet lagged.

How do I make this not last months every time? I’m getting a neck MRI in two days but I’m pretty sure after two brain MRI and an inner ear MRI, plus bloodwork multiple times, that there isn’t any disease causing this. Just anxiety doing its thing. My doctor thinks the same thing.

I’ve tried SSRI and vestibular exercices but they don’t do shit. And per my neurologist it’s not PPPD as I’ve never had it for 3 months+ and it goes away pretty ""fast"" (as far as chronic problems go I mean). But 8-10 weeks doesn’t feel fucking fast to me.

It’s gotten to the point where I honestly want to off myself some days. I can’t deal with this dizziness, head pressure and derealization anymore. Anxiety is completely ruining my life. And even when I calm down the symptoms pop up and eventually their relentlessness gives me anxiety again and the cycle self-perpetuates.

Sorry for rambling but I’m fucking tired of feeling sick all the time with every test coming back like I’m a picture of health. Not that I want a disease but I’d just like to feel as normal as my tests say I am and not freak out over having some neurological hidden disease all the time.",fuck chronically dizzy like started 2019 learned father became extremely stressed suddenly became dizzy one evening sent health anxiety tailspin lasted like 6 months dizziness stopped 10 weeks reassured clear brain mri fast forward march 2024 got dizzy sudden head movement course immediately freaked thinking gon na last months like 2019 lo behold constantly monitoring dizziness panicked another brain mri clear inner ear mri clear diagnosis basically dizziness anxiety lasted 10 weeks went away one day next became fixated another health september 2 party house got anxious dizziness hit like fucking idiot started panicking thinking oh gon na last months quit since dizziness room spinning inside head feels like spinning worse upright walking feel like bobble head also get feelings pressure head pretty bad derealization like vision keep head movements feel like see everything window like dream state feel like high severely jet lagged make last months every time getting neck mri two days pretty sure two brain mri inner ear mri plus bloodwork multiple times disease causing anxiety thing doctor thinks thing tried ssri vestibular exercices shit per neurologist pppd never 3 goes away pretty fast far chronic problems go mean weeks feel fucking fast gotten point honestly want days deal dizziness head pressure derealization anymore anxiety completely ruining life even calm symptoms pop eventually relentlessness gives anxiety cycle sorry rambling fucking tired feeling sick time every test coming back like picture health want disease like feel normal tests say freak neurological hidden disease time
Anxiety,139gbrl,2023-05-06 13:28:59,"I have always felt like I’m one of the most level headed people. Never experienced anxiety before - and never really understood how my wife could be so worried about things. 

Last year i got covid for the 2nd time despite being fully vaccinated etc etc. and the two weeks afterwards I have never felt so stressed / anxious. Couldn’t stop worrying and ruminating, and just had to walk constantly to try and calm myself. I would get up and leave the house or work and just walk for miles to try and calm down - which wasn’t great for my home or work life!

It was clearly an affect of being ill as I’ve never had anything like that before. I now have a greater appreciation of how my wife sometimes feels though - It was horrible. 

Things calmed down after those two weeks, but have kept ruminating a little since then. I got covid again a few weeks back, and the rumination is back big time - not the deep anxiety for no reason, just not being able to stop thinking / worrying about the same thing over an over until it is replaced with something else to worry about! Normally work related - conversations or errors. 

I should qualify that I think I have always ruminated - well - I have a few what I call ‘default thoughts’ that I always return to. I think this is part of rumination? But I have never worried about them - just focussed on them. The difference now is that I focus on negative things and can’t stop worrying about them until I replace it with something else.

I guess my questions are
a) i think this is covid related as I’ve never really ‘worried’ before, but every thing I read about post covid anxiety is about worrying about your own health. Mine is related to work and my kids. Do you think this is long covid related? Any experience of how long it lasts? 
b) has anyone got any good tips / links for dealing with rumination?

Anxiety,15q1fox,2023-08-13 20:44:14,"I caught covid in November 2022 and until a couple of months ago I had hell:

\- Post exertion malaise(if I climbed several steps then I was in bed for 3-4 days)

\- Neurological pain

\- Muscle pain in the legs

\- conjunctivitis

\- skin rashes

\- muscle tremors

\- POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) I had 150 beats just by standing up for months.

\- depression

\- Lack of sleep

\- nightmares

If that were not enough, my second daughter was born in January, and I have dealt with this disease in the best possible way, but come on, committing suicide passed through my head.

Now, the problem is that when I started to get better in June, **anxiety started**, and it's getting worse and worse and I don't understand why. I'm super happy to have gotten over this shit, but my head seems to have another fight for me..... I don't understand why it doesn't let me enjoy my day to day anymore and I have this feeling as soon as I get up in the morning.There are days that I don't have that feeling, and that's what I don't quite understand.

Anxiety,fun06n,2020-04-04 09:31:32,"DISCLAIMER: I don't write this to say that young or healthy people should ignore the pandemic and take no precautions. It is our obligation to do so.

But, recently, I've been coming across several news of victims of Covid-19 who were outside of the reported age of risk (+60 years old) and also worked out and ate healthy. Some of them working as medics or nurses. And I know it's really sad, and scary, and drives our anxiety up because it makes us believe that this pandemic will be pretty much the Black Death Part 2 and it's open season on all mankind.

However, there's something we must recognize: young victims are featured in the news because their cases are very rare, and newspapers and TV stations crave for stories like this. Because *bad news or tragic stories get views*. For instance, there was this tragic story of a [16 year old French who died from Covid19](https://www.france24.com/en/20200327-16-year-old-girl-becomes-france-s-youngest-coronavirus-victim) all over the newspapers last week, and all the newspapers where I read her story detailed just how heartbroken her mother was (I live in Mexico, and reading this same story in so many different newspapers say something of how this business works). It's gonna sound grim, but when elder people with co-existing diseases die because of this virus, reporters won't even write about their lives. Unless they're celebrities, politicians or medical personnel, or unless they could get a soul-crushing heartbreaking story out of their demise, they'd be just another statistic for them.

I know that this situation is harder than and average day overall and we are scared, but this situation is note dire. It's not the end of the world or everything we know and love, and we must keep our minds healthy the same as our bodies. So, if you suffer from anxiety for reading the news and tend to refresh reddit all the time, I recommend you to take a break and stop browsing it. Or at least, stop browsing news and politics subreddits. Stay away from /r/news, /r/worldnews or /r/coronavirus (this last one is doomer trash). Stay informed, yes, but also stay vigilant of what you read; some of it is awful on purpose. 

Before I go, i'd like to recommend you a couple of things. If you have trouble staying away from reading news of the pandemic all the time, you can find help at /r/nosurf. It has helped me a lot. I also recommend you to read this article by author Mark Manson: [""Why should you quit the news""](https://markmanson.net/why-you-should-quit-the-news), which I'm sure will help you cope with news anxiety

mentalhealth,1jcqkv2,2025-03-16 22:53:16,"Was going to make a throw away or something but fuck it. I am just feeling too depressed to even care. But anyways as the title said I had been dealing with the return of depression for 5 years now. I guess I will do a little run down on the major factors. 

I had dealt with depression before and by 2 psychiatrists did diagnosed with PTSD in 2015. After having gotten some help (I think that mental health care was a little better back then) from a great consoler and living with an older lady who got me the help I really needed it was from middle 2016 to like late 2019 where I felt the most happiest. Then when Covid came and forced us all to stay home for months my depression came back as I was unable to hang out with anyone or see my Boyfriend. Sure I did have online friends but being able to physically hang out with friends is something that online friends can't fully do since most of not all live in other countries. Soon we were all free from lock down and well despite being able to go out again I still felt depressed but figure over time it will run it's coarse. Then in 2021 my adoptive Sister passed away and months later a friend passes away so 2021 is indeed one of the worst years for me. That was when I attempted to get some help at least months after my friend passed away and I learn that Primary Care Network (That is the only free mental health care in my area) then said that they only do short term. I tried to get the Consoler I had seen in the past and on the day she was supposed to call me as I went home early to talk with her since i knew it would be emotional she never did call so I had to call PCN and turns out the Consoler for what ever reason marked me as a miss call despite my phone never going off once and I was literally home early for that call. Then to make matters worse I was told that it was also her last day. I literally begged them to give me her phone call or call her and ask her if they could give me her number but no. So I was set up with another consoler but not much progress was made and despite the last call of her saying she was going to call me back she never did. I just gave up dealing with PCN as it just added more stress to me and feeling like the system gave up on me was not a feeling I wanted to keep dealing with.   
  
In summer of 2023 I was contacted by my long lost birth brothers and uncle and my uncle was able to make it possible for me to meet my Mom. Now why would this be something that would make me happy? All my life I was neglected from having a Mom. My dad's first Wife up and left only a couple years after I was adopted and she completely disappeared when the was no longer getting money from the Government for ""taking care"" of me since I was living with my adoptive Dad and not her since she didn't seem like she wanted to put in effort of being a parent anymore. My dad got remarried when I was like 10 or 11 and well overtime my Stepmom's true colors showed and she soon made it clear that she didn't want me at all. She loves her 2 sons she has with my adoptive Dad and my Adoptive Dad puts them way before me despite me being in my his Family longer. My Stepmom put me through a lot of pain and aguish since she pretty much destroyed my wish of having a Mom. So you probably can only imagine how happy I was to finally meet my actual Mom. Then during this passed Christmas holidays she passed away. I would explain but yeah. I am struggling a lot right now.

mentalhealth,1jaftl8,2025-03-13 21:48:41,"Hi, for context, I live in England, and was 13 when COVID hit. It’s 5 years to the day when our school was shut and lockdown was announced. This is my diary entry I wrote earlier, it was more of a vent than anything.

It’s been 5 years since the announcement of Lockdown by Boris Johnson. I remember that dark grey Wednesday P5 science with Miss Stanley (not her real name) when she told us that school would be shut for two weeks. We all believed it would be 2 weeks. Never, I believe, out of all the many wrongs in my life, have I been more wrong. These 5 years of chaos, terror, isolation and difficulty have, and will continue to dictate (hopefully to a lesser degree) the future course of my life. I wonder who I would be and what position I would be in otherwise. COVID’s left its scars already, and given the continuing pressures (leaving school, exams, family life etc), Im far from out the woods yet. I’ve become a much harsher, sometimes somewhat duller figure since then - my eyes themselves look physically tired, even after a good nights sleep. I’ve been depressed and in therapy, navigated horrible mood swings, loneliness and reclusion and from 23-24 a really shitty job. Everything politically, seems worse and looking at that the future seems bleaker than ever. Yet I must hope, and indeed must be the hope I strive for. Been stuck for 5 years in this shit. Grandads gone, Charlie (not his real name) too. I’ve handled their deaths, and I’ve become even more balanced, productive, and at times happier than ever in the last year or so. But there’s a lot of times of hopelessness and it doesn’t feel quite as bright as it used to. I suppose that’s growing up. I’ve struggled with faith (I am currently atheist), eating too much, and masturbation. Sometimes, if I relapse, I feel farther away than ever from my goals. My physical scars, although I have gained a few, are little compared to the state of has left my mind on. I’ve missed important lessons and moments, which hasn’t helped. It’s been 5 years of decline, 5 years of shit with little to show for it save shattered dreams, fraying relationships and a greying psyche. And sitting here now, having just resisted the urge of starting smoking, little has really changed. I may look better, have good nights out with friends and even be more stabilising than I was, but the sun just isn’t as bright, nor the future, nor the music as loud and the happiness as intense. When I have happy times, I never feel quite as ‘present’ as before. I’ve tried and tried and tried, and been knocked down time and again. I have become more resilient and patient thanks to this, and 24/25 i’ve been more productive, and probably at some times, happier than ever. But despite all my victories, it feels as if what I’m striving for, no longer exists. The future days will be long (exams etc) but I must keep finding new purpose despite everything. I can sense, despite the ups and downs, a slow healing, but part of me will never be the same.",hi context live england 13 covid hit 5 years day school shut lockdown announced diary entry wrote earlier vent anything 5 years since announcement lockdown boris johnson remember dark grey wednesday p5 science miss stanley real name told us school would shut two weeks believed would 2 weeks never believe many wrongs life wrong 5 years chaos terror isolation difficulty continue dictate hopefully lesser degree future course life wonder would position would otherwise covid left scars already given continuing pressures leaving school exams family life etc im far woods yet become much harsher sometimes somewhat duller figure since eyes look physically tired even good nights sleep depressed therapy navigated horrible mood swings loneliness reclusion really shitty job everything politically seems worse looking future seems bleaker ever yet must hope indeed must hope strive stuck 5 years shit grandads gone charlie real name handled deaths become even balanced productive times happier ever last year lot times hopelessness feel quite bright used suppose growing struggled faith currently atheist eating much masturbation sometimes relapse feel farther away ever goals physical scars although gained little compared state left mind missed important lessons moments helped 5 years decline 5 years shit little show save shattered dreams fraying relationships greying psyche sitting resisted urge starting smoking little really changed may look better good nights friends even stabilising sun bright future music loud happiness intense happy times never feel quite present tried tried tried knocked time become resilient patient thanks productive probably times happier ever despite victories feels striving longer exists future days long exams etc must keep finding new purpose despite everything sense despite ups downs slow healing part never

mentalhealth,fjsi63,2020-03-17 02:41:35,"I've struggled with depression for years. Took breaks from school, gone through periods when I've done nothing but stay in bed all day. Failed many courses as a result. Terrible hygiene, binge eating, completely messy room.  Feeling completely hopeless about the future. Basically all the hallmark symptoms.  

 However I recently started doing so much better. I moved out of my parents finally into a student house. (the environment was very toxic but I was so afraid to move out because I thought the lack of accountability from them would make me worse). I started university again and developed a really set routine: Wake up every morning 7:30, shower, make breakfast, go to class. Study. I slept no later than 12:00. I started volunteering at multiple places. I cooked ALL my meals. I started to reconnect with friends I isolated myself from for years.  I was doing well academically. I even filed a petition to remove some of  my failed grades from my transcript. I was talking regularly to a counsellor and we actively were working on making good friends and getting out of my bubble. 

And then suddenly in the past week it seems like my whole life started crashing down. NBA (I'm a big fan)- cancelled. In person classes-cancelled, All my volunteering-cancelled. All the gyms-cancelled.  All the extracurricular activities I was in-cancelled. My church-cancelled. Even the public library is cancelled. All of my roommates were returning home so our house was empty and I was basically forced by my parents to come home. Now I'm essentially being forced to stay inside all the time. I honestly feel like everything I've worked so hard to maintain is falling apart. I have no chance of making friends now when nobody is even leaving their house.   But it's hard to express this to people without feeling like I'm complaining or being selfish. I've randomly burst into tears in the past few days. Just when I started doing well and thinking positively about my life and my future it seems like it was all snatched away. 

I had plans to also take classes during the spring term at my school (the spring term starts in May) but I don't even know if this will all be over by then. Trump literally just said on tv this could last until July or August. I feel like my life is over. 

For so long I avoided headlines about COVID-19. I even blocked words related to it on my twitter because I didn't want to surrounded myself with the hysteria and panic and I thought it was no big deal and people were overreacting. And now I can't avoid it. My parents constantly have the news on talking about it. It's all anyone is talking about around me. We visit a family friend yesterday and it was all they were talking about. I feel like I honestly don't know what to do. I know it seems dramatic but it always seems like something starts going wrong in my life when I start doing better.

First 1 and a half month it was disbelief and absolute break down of my ability to work. So my relatives sent me to my uncle and aunt known for the strictness and discipline ""for correctional purposes"" within a week or two I was at odds with my aunt due to the unkind things she used to say about my parents that they should have been more strict with me they coddled me and I shouldn't voice my opinions and I should have figured by life out by now. This bred resentment and anger towards her deep rooted anger that is and went into a silent bubble for almost 9 months .

I got my first referral when I was 17, after years of putting it off. I was referred to CAMHS and they turned me away because I would be 18 by the time I got to the front of the waiting list.

Then when I was at uni I kept going to my GP and all he did was offer me antidepressants. He wouldn't even listen to my symptoms. He just heard ""mental health"" and tried to prescribe them to me. I didn't know you could self refer to therapy.

When I was 21 I found out you can self refer to therapy and did. Then right after that I got kicked out of uni for my mental health and had to move away, meaning I couldn't go any further with that referral.

I moved to London but I was technically, legally homeless, so I couldn't register with a GP because you need proof of address (and you need to be registered in order to self refer). I was trying to get registered for about a year. Then I finally moved somewhere legally and I could register. I self referred but then they took me off the system because I didn't reply to a letter that I never received. They said I could refer again in a few months. 

I ended up going to A&E one day and I got really lucky. They actually took me seriously and I was referred to a psychologist, who saw me the next week. She was great and she offered me 5 more sessions. But then I got fired because of my mental health and I had to move back home (which I really, really didn't want to do) immediately. So I lost those sessions.

I registered with a GP back home and self referred to therapy. I finally got an appointment and we talked through everything. The lady said that I'm medium risk and the only reason I'm not high risk is because I assured her I'd be okay for four weeks. She said that I'm too much for them though (I have dissociation, extreme mood swings, severe anxiety focusing mainly on health and death, and a history of trauma) and referred me for a ""specialist mental health assessment"". 

I got a letter about it and I called the number. They told me my referral hadn't been processed yet and to call back in a week. I did and they said the same thing. This went on for about a month. Then they told me that my referral is cancelled, to start again once COVID-19 is over and to call the Samaritans if I need to, even though when I have a bad mood swing my brain doesn't work like that.

I don't know what do do. Everything is worse. The dissociation, the mood swings. The anxiety is through the roof given what it tends to focus on.

I just don't know how I can survive this year. Either COVID-19 will kill me or my mental health will.

I have never thought that she was gaslighting me but her accusations made me question my reality often.  I love her deeply but she has always struggled to feel loved.  2 1/2 years ago Covid inflammation damaged my brain causing multiple issues.  My brain is hypometabolic. I have constant dizziness and headache if I’m upright, standing or sitting.  My memory is very poor.  Sometimes I have difficulty speaking.   I struggle with depression and anxiety.  
 2 years ago I hugged my wife and told her I loved her.  She did not respond.  I told her that it had been years since she said “I love you” back.  She said she didn’t want to lie to me.  My wife has been in therapy for many years. She told me that she had been diagnosed with PPD by multiple psychologists.  She told me that she can’t love me.  Ever since she takes my anxiety as a slight against her.  If I ask her if I can help that implies that she is helpless.  If I disagree with her, that means I think she’s stupid.  I am very careful of my words and tone as I have dealt with this for years.    She is getting worse despite years of therapy and medication.  She screams at me that she hates me, that I made her hate me.  She asked me to move out to “give her a break”.  It has been 7 months and she won’t talk to me.

mentalhealth,141z2hm,2023-06-06 06:56:05,"Hello. My name is Lilly and I am a teenager who struggled through COVID-19. I was in my sophomore year of high school when the announcement was made that schools would be going online for just two weeks. As many of you know, it turned into a month, then into a year and even into two years for most of us. Right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was diagnosed with depression. Through the pandemic I had to work with my psychiatrist to find the right balance of medications because I had also been diagnosed with moderate OCD. After I got medicated for my OCD, I started getting really depressed to the point where I wouldn’t have the energy nor will to even open my mouth to talk. My psychiatrist then diagnosed me as being Bipolar. See, the thing with having OCD and being Bipolar is, usually OCD is “treated” with an anti-depressant but my psychiatrist had to prescribe me with a mood stabilizer because anti-depressants cause people who are Bipolar to have a more destabilized mood a.k.a. Be more depressed. Before COVID-19 I was struggling to keep my grades up because I was so mentally unstable and unmedicated. I really struggled being online because the little social interaction I was getting was with my family and they kind of drove me crazy. My mental health was a mess and my high school didn’t take into account the toll of a new lifestyle on their students so they didn’t adapt well to transferring online.  
I had to find a way to cope with my mental health issues because it felt as though I was drowning. I found something that would keep me afloat and help me practically survive this intense time in our lives. So, I did. I found music! Specifically a group called BTS. When I first discovered them, I was still in school in person but through COVID-19 I really connected with them and they saved my life. It’s really scary to think that not even my family could do what BTS did for me. What’s even crazier is that I don’t even know them personally nor do they know me and yet, they still did so much for me. This was and still is my coping strategy for hard times. I just listen to their music and get reminded of my purpose in this world.  
I came on here to write about my experience with the pandemic and to share what my coping strategy was. I want to hear everybody’s story and how people survived a traumatic time in our world.

mentalhealth,160zft7,2023-08-25 19:02:23,"It was quite an irony that I had caught COVID-19 just when passengers in pubic transportations are granted the freedom of not wearing a facemask. Of course, I've been cured, with a grateful heart. But the process of my treatment had been excruciating since the doctor forbad me from any use of anti-depressants. It was not the COVID that was getting me but my inner demons.   
I began to see what a sensitive, sad person I could be, and I dislike that person. I consider myself a person blessed with the courage, the grits to look at the darkness in the eye without being corrupted. Due to my commitment to art, I spent months illustrating the 72 demons, which I designed as fortune-telling gimmicks, from the Lesser Key of Solomon. I thought to myself, if you were without ill-intentions, why be afraid? These entities were just former ""angels"" who chose the wrong side of the fight with God. I was fascinated by this newly found dark energy, which could be magically healing.   
I suppose, anti-depressants serve as a filter that had kept me from seeing my true changes. I was not corrupted by darkness. Instead, darkness had weakened me to a point where I felt so frail and helpless about my life that I wanted an end. However, I knew I'm not supposed to think in this way, but I could not help it. I had been almost defeated, beaten up but made great efforts to arise and continue the..I wouldn't say the fight...more like my task, my mission, my calling of life.   
I don't like how my life is now. But I was not unhappy because I would always find things to do as attempts to make a tiny difference. I changed my focus and stayed neutral in the grey zone of life. With medical intervention, I'm capable of doing that.  
I knew most episodes of my emotional life were meaningless. People I met seem nice but are not genuinely kind. I was able to tolerate that state of meaninglessness under meds. In actuality, it is hurting me and eating each bit of me every day. My perception of life is a scene of someone being surrounded/raped by a group of bullies while no one else stops to help and intervene. Truly, everyone for himself. Chance is everything. It is no one's duty to help any people in need unless you have personal bonding with that person. I thought life is cruel. I do not exist. I do not matter. I have two-face mentality - everything is chance, and chance is the only thing that is fair in this world.   
I'm able to live with the thoughts and change my focus when the pills give me an edge to cheer. I knew my mind is sick but I could not help myself. Each moment was living hell. The memory of similar circumstances kept coming to my head - you are ghosted and will always be ghosted, dismissed and humiliated, especially from people you come to like. It is a curse you must live with. Life is shit. Deal with it.   
My true feeling: I don't wanna live with that. I wanna end. I could spend each minute in tears over one thing or another. People's malice and cowardice hurt me. It is not fair. The world is so ugly that I don't wanna be in it. Please let us all perish like dinousaurs.   
Anyhow, I got rid of my COVID. I'm back on pills. That cool ease comes back. I'm able to change my focus and enjoy the small things in life like a good book or a good documentary.",quite irony caught passengers pubic transportations granted freedom wearing facemask course cured grateful heart process treatment excruciating since doctor forbad use covid getting inner demons began see sensitive sad person could dislike person consider person blessed courage grits look darkness eye without corrupted due commitment art spent months illustrating 72 demons designed gimmicks lesser key solomon thought without afraid entities former angels chose wrong side fight god fascinated newly found dark energy could magically healing suppose serve filter kept seeing true changes corrupted darkness instead darkness weakened point felt frail helpless life wanted end however knew supposed think way could help almost defeated beaten made great efforts arise continue would say fight like task mission calling life like life unhappy would always find things attempts make tiny difference changed focus stayed neutral grey zone life medical intervention capable knew episodes emotional life meaningless people met seem nice genuinely kind able tolerate state meaninglessness meds actuality hurting eating bit every day perception life scene someone group bullies one else stops help intervene truly everyone chance everything one duty help people need unless personal bonding person thought life cruel exist matter mentality everything chance chance thing fair world able live thoughts change focus pills give edge cheer knew mind sick could help moment living hell memory similar circumstances kept coming head ghosted always ghosted dismissed humiliated especially people come like curse must live life shit deal true feeling wan na live wan na end could spend minute tears one thing another people malice cowardice hurt fair world ugly wan na please let us perish like dinousaurs anyhow got rid covid back pills cool ease comes back able change focus enjoy small things life like good book good documentary

mentalhealth,ruwbq4,2022-01-03 13:18:06,"I know I’m not special and everyone is suffering from pandemic fatigue, but I don’t know how much longer I can do this. Every time there is even the tiniest sliver of hope that this garbage will be over soon, every time the light at the end of the tunnel seems so close, I see headlines about new strains and strict border closings and the unavailability of hospital beds.

I just want normalcy. I want to walk out in public without feeling like everything is collapsing around me. I know that this is serious and I know that people are dying. I know that even the people that survive sometimes end up with debilitating long-term side effects. I know that the healthcare system is understaffed and overwhelmed. I’m just so tired. I had to stop watching the news altogether because of COVID. I just couldn’t take listening to people talk about disease and death and general turmoil anymore.

I think the thing that breaks my heart the most about all this is that the entire time I was in college, all I wanted to do was travel and see the world, but I was in a serious relationship and had bills to pay, so that was not happening. Guess what year I graduated? Yeah, 2019. You know, the year the pandemic started. I was a real adult for a whole six months. I was finally free from the shackles of higher education, and I got a job where I actually had vacation time. Not like it mattered. 

One of the things hitting me hardest right now is the place I want to go most is the place with about the most stringent border restrictions in the world. I know that Japan is trying to protect its citizens, and I understand and respect that. I’m just frustrated because I thought my life was going to start after graduation. I know, I KNOW the world doesn’t revolve around me, but it’s just a real slap in the face that I was ready and able to start living for myself for the first time and the world went to absolute shit. Like, of course it did. After everything I went through in my college career leading up to that May, it felt personal. It still does. 

Now, I’m no longer in a serious relationship and I have even more freedom to live my own life, but instead of enjoying it the way I deserve to be, I’m just sitting alone in this empty house longing for something that is so far out of reach that it’s almost pathetic. It just feels like yet another grain of salt in the wound. I have all the necessary means to live my dreams, and now everything is completely out of my control.

Basically, before Covid, I used to be the most social person in the room. I was always super self-confident, and I could strike up a conversation with anyone. Since Covid, I slowly started developing strong social anxiety due to probably being isolated and living alone.

Whenever I go out and it’s in familiar environments, I can manage my anxiety and I usually forget it if I am drinking. But when it comes to travelling and meeting new people, I tend to always be fighting off panic attacks and just constant social anxiety.

I keep thinking man what if I just pass out right now or throw up, will they judge me? Every time I get social anxiety too, I end up getting very warm, nausea, diarrhea and all that.

I get really depressed and overwhelmed sometimes because I can’t help but think about how I was literally in my prime before Covid and now it almost feels like I gotta build myself up again. Like I’ve injured myself in a way almost but just in my mind.

Every time when I asked anyone to pull down their masks so that I could understand them I would be met with so many looks that it put me off asking people to pull down their masks, and instead just guessing what they were saying.

When mask mandates finally started to lift, initially I was pleased as it meant that I could finally start to understand people again. However 2 years of staying in small social groups and steering away from busy areas meant that I didn't have to deal with background noise. 

When I finally started to go back to eating at restaurants with friends, or hanging out at a cafés I realised I couldn't hear what any of them were saying despite the fact that I was lipreading and the background noise wasn't above normal levels. 

I had never felt more isolated in my life than those moments where I was literally apart of a group of my beloved friends and I couldn't understand them despite them trying their best to accommodate me.

Now, I don't really hang out with friends unless we are at someone's house (which is rarely) or we organise something online over discord.

Combined with the fact that I won't be graduating uni with them (because I am the only one doing a placement year at a company elsewhere in the country), has left me feeling quite distant with them.

I don't really have friends which are local to me either. The only people I interact with a lot are my flatmates (where I am the youngest by 10 years); or my work colleagues. I could call a couple of them ""friends"" but not in the way that would warrant us hanging out outside of work.

Then the cherry on top of everything is that one of the major things which is causing my depression at the moment is my weight.

Before several months before COVID I was going to the gym regularly I had a daily routine and everything and it was great. 

But then someone who I had talked with on tinder started stalking me at the gym, and despite me talking to the uni (who rand the gym) and relevant officials, they couldn't really do anything about it. 

So I had to change up my schedule for working out to be more predictable but then eventually it became such a hassle that I stopped going, thinking I was going to wait until this guy who was in his final year if uni would leave meaning I could start a routine again. 

Then COVID hit and the gyms closed. I thought okay I will just wait until the gyms open again. I even had my second year accommodation which was a brand new complex of which a gym would be finished a couple months into my stay so even if it lasted that long I would eventually have a gym.

Then a month into my second year the gym still wasn't finished because the accomodation needed to order the gym  equipment. However people had already started to use the space in the mean time as a second movie room or an empty space if you need it

A couple months in a bunch of people petitioned the room to remain as an open space, meaning that the equipment for a gym was never delivered as they canceled the order.

I rarely went out because it was still COVID and ate unhealthily (I am a binge eater as I become endlessly hungry when bored or stressed), and I gained weight increasing my clothes size twice.

I am currently very depressed and i want to lose weight because I know I will be a lot happier being less overweight. But I have no motivation to do anything much less exercise or go to my local gym. 

I want to exist in this world. I like existing in in this world and I would even say I am quite good at it. I get good grades and I do well at work. I am known to be a friendly person to talk to. I am the go to person if you ever have an issue because I will be there to listen and give a thoughtful yet blunt answer.

However I constantly feel like I am at a disadvantage because of my hearing and COVID exposed to me how much effort I put in to existing in the hearing world and that I could lose much of my social life if my hearing level dropped considerably without warning.

I don't even have the motivation to even start the process of making myself happier, despite the fact that used to love exercising. It's just a depressive catch 22 where I need to motivation to exercise so I can get out of my depression but I have depression and little motivation to do the exercise.

mentalhealth,10eekbk,2023-01-17 20:40:09,"How do I deal with an autistic child (13F, UK) with a dirt phobia? To the point at which they have panic attacks, pull their hair out, and are physically sick and violent? 

Can be triggered by seeing dried water marks on a mopped floor in a supermarket or crumbs in a cafe, someone else sitting in a seat that is usually theirs (the seat coverings are now considered dirty), or a box being delivered and then placed on the floor they walk on (box is considered to be dirty from being in a van, and will have spread the dirt to the air surrounding where the box was placed). 

They will only travel in one car (despite the others being clean). Won't go in the same room as my dogs (which I've owned for 10yrs+), won't go in the garden for any more than a few minutes (except for when it snowed, and only when that was completely fresh, once she, I or the dogs had walked on it it was considered a no-go area). Will only use soap that is solely theirs.

Their autism means that they are extremely ""black-and-white"" with things and take everything incredibly literally, missing nuances frequently. They will not talk about the dirt phobia outside of saying that it originated in the covid lockdowns. During covid, we had to take extra care due to an immediate family member being immunocompromised following chemotherapy, but nothing extreme or out of the ordinary.

mentalhealth,jtsdjl,2020-11-14 06:14:09,"Hi everyone! So a little background. I'm a full time nurse in the US and have been since 2013. I am also a mother to two boys and I'm in college part time to further my degree. I started back in college last August. 

I'm posting because I am so completely overwhelmed, depressed, and anxious. It's... overwhelming. I've always had bouts of depression and I live with anxiety but it used to be pretty manageable. I would have maybe 3 or 4 panic attacks a year. I've never been on any anxiety or depression medication because I feel like I've been able to manage it ok without. 

In March we sent our kids to live with my in-laws until we learned more about COVID because my in-laws already watched the boys when both my husband and I were working and my job is considerably high risk. A week after that I came down with COVID and the kids ended up living with my in-laws for 11 weeks. We talked on Zoom but that was it. That period of my life was the absolute darkest period of my life. I cried multiple times a day and was in the deepest pits of depression that I have ever known. I would cry multiple times a day and I was having panic attacks every week, often in the middle of work, and contemplated suicide for the first time in my life. There was absolutely no joy in life. The phone calls with my kids always ended with me leaving early because I was crying to much and I didn't want them to see. 

Anyway they've been home for a couple months and things have been better but it's still a struggle. I continue to disassociate throughout the day and every couple of weeks I feel like I ""wake up"" from a depressive episode. I'm still having panic attacks every few weeks. For instance, I had a really really bad one today. A manager at Trader Joe's gave me flowers and said thank you for being a nurse and for when I got back to my car I just....broke. His kindness broke me, for some stupid reason. I was sobbing and hyperventilating and my hands went numb and I almost blacked out. It was very rough. 

My question is this- I know that I'm depressed. I know that my anxiety is at an all time high. I know that I should seek help. But I also know that this is all related to COVID. It's related to nursing in a pandemic, the isolation, and the general uncertainty in the world. Therefor, I think that this will end. I believe that it will. I don't want to start medication when COVID is, hopefully, a temporary problem. Many depression/ anxiety medication have a ton of side effects and are hard to stop one they've been started. What would you do? Should I just keep soldiering through or seek medication?  Thanks y'all.

mentalhealth,sm5ied,2022-02-07 01:12:32,"I've worked from home for several years now, long before it became cool due to covid.  It never bothered me, I always had fairly good discipline to do my job (funny how a paycheck motivates you!) and pre-covid I loved it, I would wake up and go to the kitchen grab a coffee then over to my office and I was at work.  No commute!

I moved back to my home town after 20 years away 2 years ago.  (There's a few friends that I have in the area but when I first got back here, I was transferring from Alberta to Vancouver Island, you can make the trip in about 14 hours if you hustle). I basically took over the entire island, the only guy from my company decided to go to management and I took his role.  I was busy AF. I worked from home (no big deal) and I didn't get out much ( as I live about 30 minutes out of the city).

The only people I've really met are clients and typically they are not the type of people you would become friends with...just the nature of the business.

9 months after moving back here I ran into an old friend from 20 years ago through Facebook Dating, and we hit it off.  After my last 3 failed LTRs, this one seemed like a fairy tale.  Long story short, I was dumped just shy of our 2 year anni.  Apparently I had triggered something in her and I reminded her of her ex-husband when I would drink. (By the way I'm not a heavy drinker or even remotely close).  Her friends became my friends and I really didn't get out much as we live 35 minute drive from each other, and I was ok with that.

So that was last August.  Covid has really taken a toll on me because there isn't much to do (there already isn't in this small town), I have never felt so isolated in my life.

I did all the things you are supposed to do to get over a break up (being in my mid 40s this isn't the first time this has happened although this is the first time I was blindsided and looking back on it 6 months later, I really had no clue.  There were no signs (because her ex husband ended up checking into rehab 6 weeks before this all went down). I also saw her the day before and not a care in the world...the text messages showed no signs either.

* I meditated
* got a counsellor that I still see
* I tried drawing (which I'm horrible at)
* I took a couple of pottery classes
* I started massage therapy
* I started reiki therapy
* I practiced gratitude
* I started working out (2 months later I was having a bad day and ended up tearing a chest muscle which took me out for 6 weeks)
* I quit drinking 3 days after she blindsided me, I started drinking again on my birthday.  Nothing too exciting but I will say over Christmas I felt guilty about drinking.
* I quit smoking 2 weeks after I quit drinking 162 days today.
* I ride a One Wheel skateboard when the weather is nice, I did some really long rides and got my longest ride without stopping, it was 32 miles
* I traded my truck for a better truck, steep payment but it sure is nice and I use it for work too.
* I joined a Rotary Club and started doing some volunteer work.
* One Wheel season ended and I was stuck, what do I do?....Mount Washington is 45 minutes from my driveway.  I decided I was going to learn how to snowboard the day after my 47th birthday.  I also have nerve damage in my left foot, I broke my pelvis 25 years ago (and dislocated leg and injured that sciatic nerve) I broke my neck and back  6 years ago. (to add to the difficulty factor)
* YESTERDAY WAS MY 15th day on a snowboard ever and this season( I went all in and bought a season pass).  I would have been up today but I needed to get some work done.

So I am doing ALL THE THINGS anyone could possibly do to get over a break up, in the middle of a pandemic which exacerbates going through this.

Now we have ""Trucker Protests"" and there's a large contingent of my friends that are all on board with this.  Personally I don't care if you want to protest but stay out of my way.  I had to mute a bunch of my friends because I can't stand the crap they post.

Politics! Covid! Russia! China! Inflation! There's nowhere to live and if you can find somewhere it's unaffordable! Gas is going up! Bills are going up!

I gave up asking for help (Everybody wants to post ""Bell, Let's Talk"" or make some post about mental health and I need 5 friends blablabla to repost this post, but when it comes down to it...not many people want to listen to your problems after a few days, I still do not feel ""over it"".

I feel abandoned from my friends and family. I am bitter about the friends and family that I lost when she dumped me.  All her friends who I could have sworn were my friends vaporized.  We're still ""Facebook friends"" but that's about it.  Rarely do they react to anything I post.  I even feel bitter about my own family and friends not staying in touch and checking in with me.  I was in some pretty dark times and I can' count the number of suicide methods I contemplated.  It's a good thing I don't own a gun because I'm sure that would have sped up the contemplating.

I make posts on Facebook but I really put in effort to not repost news, or politics, or covid, or protest bullshit.  Last summer when I learned how to One Wheel I made a lot of videos and posted them, that's what I've been doing now, except snowboarding (now that I actually have an interest in shooting videos again).  It's funny to me how people just don't give a shit about seeing someone learn something new (One Wheel) I was not good at it at all, it was scary at first lol.  Same with snowboarding, I'm all over the mountain now and just got good enough last weekend to start bringing my camera out.  I try to make it entertaining (but I know nobody wants to watch a 30 minute video when you have the attention span of a gnat.

Normally I don't care if anyone likes it or not, but I'm feeling the lack of love that's for sure.  I'm posting original content, I  rarely post memes.

I really feel fake most of the time.  It's a front, I am not ok, I hardly have any drive or ambition for work (which is not my character at all), nobody wants to talk to me about this anymore because it's old news now, so I just give up and don't bring it up.

mentalhealth,1jrpkb0,2025-04-05 04:45:23,"I’m 23, and I always thought my mental health struggles were just a result of entering adulthood—more responsibilities, transitioning from student life, trying to figure out who I am, etc. But lately, I’ve been noticing something deeper going on—not just with me, but with everyone around me.

I keep reading about 15 and 16-year-olds suffering from brain fog, anxiety, depression, even suicidal thoughts. That terrifies me. These are kids. What’s happening to us?

Is it really just social media messing with our brains? Is it COVID and the long-term psychological or even physical effects? Is it the state of the world—economically, socially, environmentally? Or are we just becoming more aware of mental health issues that always existed?

I know part of it is the overwhelming amount of technology in our lives—how it’s created this weird paradox where we’re constantly connected but feel more isolated than ever. It’s like we’re surrounded by people online but starved for real connection in real life.

I mean, I’m sure if you were living 200 years ago, these things didn’t exist, right? Or at least not at this scale. People weren’t constantly anxious, mentally burnt out, or numb at 16. What the hell is going on?

I don’t know. It just feels like something is off with this entire generation. Like we’re all slowly slipping. I’d love to hear your thoughts—do you feel the same? Do you think there’s a bigger reason behind this mental health crisis?

mentalhealth,rl2uyp,2021-12-21 07:07:48,"I’m having a hard time navigating this and I want to preface it by saying that my roommate and I have open, honest conversations about this stuff, but I still struggle with knowing what’s reasonable or not.

My roommate is more lax and I’m more risk-averse and cautious. We do our best to meet in the middle in terms of taking precautions, but it still seems to be a continuing source of conflict. We get along very well in every other aspect in general and are compatible—I’m just looking for some perspective.

In a nutshell, I have generalized anxiety and express my concerns to her and don’t want to be overbearing since she’s an autonomous adult, but at the same time her decisions affect me. For instance, she went to a party and contracted Covid and now we’re both isolating. Some of her decisions make me uncomfortable (I always speak up) so she tries to socialize in a way that feels safer (i.e. masking indoors etc.) Sometimes she becomes upset and I get the vibe that she feels like I’m holding her back, which is not my intention at all, but I’m also trying to stay safe and be cautious about getting/spreading Covid. I don’t want to step on her toes but I also believe in transparency.

I don’t believe either of us are right or wrong, but Covid has presented everyone with a situation in which our individual choices *do* greatly affect the people around us. 

I’ve read that Covid has elicited this constant fight or flight response because we always feel like we’re in limbo and can’t tell if we’re not doing enough or doing too much.

mentalhealth,u6f7xz,2022-04-18 20:31:54,"So yeah. This is a vent and asking for support in one post.

After a super awsome weekend and finally getting back on track with a friend/fwb I got tested positive. I know this is not unusual these days, and I told that friend/fwb immediately although I know he just had it himself 6 weeks ago because I know he had contact with his parents after spending the weekend with me.

I normally would celebrate it as a reason to stay home and enjoy some me time. But the thing is I just moved to my own place 2 months ago, go through family problems and mental health issues for the first time and as I said am just back on track with that friend for 2 weeks now. Before he showed up again at my door two weeks ago, I was all alone for 3 weeks without human contact (except at the grocery store) and I really suffered under it. I just told that friend on saturday evening that I hope it won't take another two months to see each other again and that I missed spending time with him and he agreed and said he doesn't want that to happen, too. He is a huge support for me and a really good friend.

&#x200B;

So the thing with this is as follows. I need someone to get me some groceries as all delivery servies require you to spend at least 50 euros, which would mean groceries for 2 weeks if not longer when I just need a few things. The friend I would usually ask is not in town until next week. I know my friend went grocery shopping for some other friends of his that were in isolation. But I am slipping back into thinking I am a burden when I ask him if he could get some things and drop them off at my door. I don't want to ask my sister (whom I shared a flat with before my move and who lives just 600meters from me) as she will just use it to blame me or telling me how stupid I am to have gotten Covid.

The other thing is as I said the lonelyness. I know I am just required to isolate for 7-10 days. But I fear afterwards people will still not want to meet as over here there is always some kind of stigma coming with having tested positive. I am also not sure what this means for my friend and I, as I just know he did not want to have contact with his buddy for at least a month if not longer when he had it back in january, but this was before my friend got it himself. As I said we just got back on track. I am a huge overthinker and just started to cope with finally just having to care for myself after just caring for others for all my life. I just accepted I need professional help and am still learning it is ok to ask for help. So naturally I am already walking up and down my room thinking if and how and when I can ask for help. I mean sure he has to process this himself first and he asked where I think I got it and if I have symptoms/am ok. But I am still going crazy over this as I am new to asking for help and having people really care for me. I am not used to rely on others for basic things like that and it feels like loosing control.

&#x200B;

The third thing is my therapy. If I am lucky I can test myself out of isolation the day before my next appointment. I am still not there every week as I just started and was lucky there are other patients who might stop going to my therapist so I can take their place. I don't know how to handle isolation if I can't go to this appointment. I also developed walking everywhere as a coping mechanism, which of course I am not allowed to do now. Officially I am not even allowed to go out on my own at night, but I am really thinking of doing that.

So people on here- how did you deal with having to isolate if you were in a similar situation? Do you have any advice except the usual ""calm down and don't worry""?

mentalhealth,wu0q3v,2022-08-21 19:49:21,"Covid started during my junior of college. I struggled the first two years to make friends, get my footing and actually enjoy college. In junior year it was getting better. I've been reading alot, I had a startup project I was really excited about, I was actually making friends ( like not just talk in the classroom,  friends to go out with) and getting ready to look into internships. I was doing amazing mental health wise but I was definitely being better. 

Then covid, and the rest of junior year was online. It wasn't terrible at first. I was productive still and was able to keep a good attitude. Then they announced my senior year to be all online. 

That's what destroyed me. I was so excited to go out with a bang.  I was thinking of buying new clothes instead of my hoodie and jeans. I was finally going to have people to go with to our schools Halloween party. I was gonna be 21, so I'd have people to go out with for my birthday. I was ready to have a great school year since this would be my last one ever.

Then all that was just taken away. Now it's just zoom classes. I didn't want to do anything. I got up to do school and homework. Then I'd sleep the rest of the day. 

Once I graduated I didn't even want anything to do with what I studied. It just made me sad. So I just good a job in food service. 

Now one year out and my family is on me about getting a job in my field but it still makes me upset when I even think about getting a job in my field. 

It's been tough to just accept that I'll never get that good senior year. It's nobody's fault, something completely out of my control. I feel like it's holding me back tho.

But since I moved to a new city where I live on my own, on a very low income, I couldn't afford therapy anymore.

Before moving to the city I had to deal with paranoia over the vaccine. I am NOT an anti vaxxer at all, and am pro-vaccine... but as someone who's anxiety attacks prevented me from leaving my house in the past, I deal with a lot of ""what ifs"" in my head. To add to this, my mom is paranoid and a narcissistic abuser, and the year I lived with her, her paranoia wiggled its way into my personal life.

So I spoke with my therapist and my friends, who are all very supportive, and we decided to have a ""Vaccine weekend"" within a month - i know it sounds silly. And I would go get the vaccine, with my best friend by my side. Afterwards we would all have a sleepover and they'd be there to help me if I spiral. This was planned while living with my mom so I kept it a secret.

But then it happened and I had to move to my new location. Now it's been a while and I still haven't got it. My paranoia is getting worse and I can't afford therapy.

To me COVID caused the below so with that in mind anyone who talks about it really annoys me and gets under my skin and I don't want to talk to them.

Not being able to go to baby scans with my partner. Not Being able to stay with my her until she was ready to go into labour. Not being able to stay with her after my son was born. Not being able to stay with both her and my son while he was in special care. Not being able to show him off to family until 1 day before his death. Not being able to sit with loved ones at his funeral. Trapped inside the same 4 walls grieving as couldn't go out and do things to take my mind off things. Because off all of this I go through severe depression, PTSD flashbacks and anxiety.

Immediately my intense anxiety about this whole situation came out of dormancy. I spent all day waiting for my results, crying and smoking and drinking. I'm not in the right headspace to process this but here we are. I can feel a breakdown brewing in me and it feels sick. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, this feels like the last straw and I need to hospitalize myself before I lose control

I just can’t concentrate on doing them. I get bored and finish them- or even start them sometimes. I always tell my parents “It’s boring, I don’t do boring things.”. I’ll look out the window and get dirsacted and think about something coming up or maybe make up s story, I’ll go on my phone on Reddit or Wattpad or Quotev and not do schoolwork or not even listen to the teacher. I’m not interested in math, or my country’s history (especially since it’s so crazy and f*ed up), I Don’t want to learn about Anemones, or how solar energy works. I’m not interested in it and it bores me. I can get distracted and go write up a couple pages on my own subjects I’m interested while I’m supposed to be doing schoolwork. 

I’m doing %100 remote because my parents decided by themselves that the “best” thing for me is to stay home. My math teacher told us how when one student came in on the very first day his grades rose tremendously and he actually understood it because she could help him and see what he was doing. 

I also get frustrated at school, schoolwork, my teachers, my sister, and even my sister’s teachers. My school is doing “Social Emotional Learning” and I just get so agrivated at it. I get frustrated when I don’t understand my work and I’m too anxious that if I ask my teacher how to do it that they will think  I’m stupid or will think I’m a bad student because I’m asking for help on a missing assignment. My teachers are all optimists and are being super optimistic about everything, I understand some people *need* that optimism, but I don’t. I get upset when they say “Hopefully, we’ll be better by next year,” or “ It’s going to be okay”. My sister’s choir teacher has them all signing Saprano, and I can certainly tell you, my sister is *not* a saprano. We both work at the dining room table, and i *know* people are going to say “just move”, I don’t have anywhere else to work. 

I just get distracted and then my grades crash and then my parents (my father mostly) get mad and yell and make my troubles even worse. 

I’ve tried alarms, but I don’t have the motivation to actually act on them and do whatever I’m supposed to do. 

I know I’m burdening my mom with my bad grades and bad additude. And I know I’m not the best student or a very good one either.

mentalhealth,vqqx9l,2022-07-04 02:28:37,"In the first week of lockdown (within Britain), I had lost my grandfather who was an extremely important person in my life. I had left my part time job that I’d worked at for 3 and a half years, lost my dog and broke up with my now ex girlfriend all in a short space of time. Lockdown was difficult as everyone was living on top of each other, my gran completely changed, arguments were a regular thing and the whole vibe throughout it felt negative. I had only just turned 19 at the time (21 now) and it honestly depresses me and for other people, that we all missed out on those vital years to be young and enjoy life. I’m not saying that after a short period, you couldn’t enjoy life but everything was starting to get set up for myself until all these events happened within a short amount of time. I honestly feel like a huge proportion of my happiness and positivity has dissolved a good bit. Now when I look back on old videos or photos, I always seem to get very down as I can remember what life was like back before then. Now obviously there are worse things ongoing in the world right now, however I would rather post this on Reddit to gather opinions and advice from random people across the world to possibly change my perspective on things. It just feels like everything that was happening in my “old life” has faded away. For example:
- Worked in a part time (sometimes full time job) with people I got on well with and had a laugh. 
- Only started going out and enjoying adult life for a year which also included hanging out with my grandfather at the local pub (since I was a kid he always stated about taking me along and having nights with him)
- Hanging around with my friends more often
- Not having a full responsibility to look after my gran near enough 7 days a week
- Having a better relationship with my mum and dad (through continuous arguments and fights the relationship has dulled down)
- Now bring in debt as I own a car and didn’t have a job for months on end
- Overall not feeling as content as what I used to be

During the lockdown last year, I hit a big low and, even though life \*feels\* similar to how it did before the pandemic, I can't seem to bounce back spiritually.

Prior to the pandemic, I was so busy and had to work to cultivate an appreciation of the present moment, and got really into meditation & exercise to ground myself. It also used to be that if I had a day off, I'd find something to inspire and delight me. 

Then during the pandemic all the present moments that I had struggled to appreciate started to accrue into a meaningless mass, a big tub of gloop, an endless string of utterly pointless NOW, with nothing to do, no one to talk to, nowhere to go, no joy. 

Lost family and work that was a big part of my identity during COVID and had a very small dose of Prozac to get through that time, and it worked: I am still alive.

But there are things to do again, places to see, people to talk to, joy to feel. I force myself to do all sorts of stuff, then also sometimes give myself permission to rest, set goals, forgive myself for feeling XYZ.

mentalhealth,s1vej1,2022-01-12 08:26:42,"I'm sure you're all tired of hearing about this but it's just been on my mind lately and I bet a lot of you can relate.

end of 2019 I had a fun job. We'd just been married and bought a house, and I had done some traveling for work. At the time I remember feeling wrapped up in my own issues (job wasn't perfect, dysfunctional parents still popped up to torment me) but looking back on it I'd give anything to return to that.

I got offered a new job that on paper looked better. I decided to take it, with much sadness. It was a sad time as me and many of my friends quit and moved away. Literally on Decemeber 31st while having a new years party I began having some funny symptoms - I ended up sick with Covid Classic (tm) for months. 

New job did NOT pan out. I quit after 8 months after developing chronic health issues from the work environment and possibly long covid. The new job was much more restrictive and much lonlier and repetitive than my last job. I would come home from work and sit and stare at the wall for the entire evening before dragging myself into work. I didn't realize it soon enough but I was becoming deeply traumatized by it.

That was in Aug 2020. After quitting that job I began applying to new ones, but every one of them turned me down. I've been jobless (my husband has been supporting us all right, but I can't do this forever). Unfortunately it just hasn't been going well, and I don't even want to work in my field any more. I have no idea what to do, and the longer I don't work the harder it feels to return to working. I don't see anyone. I don't go anywhere. I don't want to go through the suffering of having covid again. I feel like a horrible deadbeat. I thought if I had all the time I needed I'd get into my hobbies... but that hasn't happened either. I can't seem to get myself to work on anything. Most days now I just feel nothing. All night I haven't been able to get myself to do anything. I do my best to keep the house clean and that's all I have in me. All the things I used to do for fun - thrift shop, walk around a store, see friends, maybe visit an art club or take art classes - all squashed for covid. Travel - all squashed for covid. Job interview? The ones I've been on have been maskless and left me scared. Any time I  do push the rules and go out I wonder if I've caught it. We never got to go on our honeymoon. 

Meanwhile the weather in my part of the world has changed (we used to get snow in the winter, now it's just creepily warm or dangerously cold but no snow), watching some of my favorite places I've visited in the past burn down, watching prices keep going up, politics getting worse. It just seems like nothing ever gets better and I am just exhausted.

We will hear real raw stories that will impact others on a level like never before. Give a shared space to show that you aren’t alone\~ But learn what others go through.

This topic is very important to me because this pandemic has also impacted me on an emotional level. To be honest, if it wasn't for the online twitch community. I don't know what my life would look like. As dark as that sounds.

I made a google form that people can submit and share their breaking point during covid or if covid ever impacted their mental health. All of these are submitted anonymously and selected ones will be shared on stream. Keep it as PG-13 as possible!

Then I get asked what will make me feel more comfortable, and I say something like better vaccines. Then I feel like I'm getting a vibe from them that I'm mad or hysterical.

mentalhealth,spfp4l,2022-02-11 01:36:13,"I caught COVID about a month ago, despite being vaccinated which seems to happen more often with omicron. I had pretty much every symptom in the book. After a week most of the symptoms were gone, I was just left with a nagging cough and shortness of breath. The shortness of breath was the worst and I went to the ER a couple of times but they wouldn't do anything for me, but it did start getting a better after a couple more days.

As my cough and shortness of breath have gone away, they have been replaced by what I can only describe as a dark, suffocating cloud of sadness that has been hanging over me ever since. It kind of started with me randomly one day thinking that I don't want me kids to grow up. I love my life just the way it is right now, and I don't want anything to change, but thats impossible.

Those thoughts have taken over my mind and made me sad. Uncontrollably sad. Going through my days fighting back tears at every turn kind of sad. My appetite is gone and I have to force myself to eat. I haven't had a good night of sleep in weeks. My chest feels heavy. I don't get pleasure out of any of the normal things I used to, and I don't have a desire to do many of those things anyways. Like I said, I just feel like a heavy, dark, suffocating cloud has enveloped me and I feel nothing except for sadness, worry, and fear. And just a little background about myself, I have NEVER come anywhere close to feeling depressed about anything. I've always been a very happy, content person. I'm lucky to have had and continue to have a really great life, which makes it all the more confusing as to how and why I could possibly be feeling this way seemingly out of nowhere. I have never come close to feeling anything like this in my life.

So what I am asking is, have any of you experienced or heard of someone suffering from depression as a post COVID symptom? Did COVID screw up the chemistry in my brain? Is post COVID depression a thing?

mentalhealth,p66fw7,2021-08-17 21:16:18,"I am a 17(almost 18) year old boy from India And in the past 1.5 year My life has completely changed and for the worse especially 2021 has fucked me up really good. So where do i start i have no idea. this might be a long post for some people to read.

So my life before COVID was a simple and happy one. I was in 10th grade  I had no stress no anxiety no fear and I used to come home listen to music and watch YouTube and have fun all the time. my studies were there but they were not that difficult or hard to handle. my health especially my mental health was in great shape because I was meeting my friends everyday in school and we would play games and do fun stuff and laugh our brains out. also I would frequently go out to places with my family( restaurants, malls etc.) also to be very honest I was sexually frustrated and I'd get a lot of alone time plus I had shit tones of energy in my body. 

Ever since Lockdown due to COVID began my life has changed and it has gotten worse and i am stuck in a loop of stress--depression--tension--anxiety--frustration.

So firstly I wasted my time in 2020 as everyday in the beginning of the lockdown felt like a Sunday and I had recently given my boards examination so it was a good time period first two months were enjoyable as there was no work from school no career oriented pressure. But then the devil's bell rang and i started getting health anxiety because I had no physical exercise from the past 2-3 months and as a result of that my body was becoming weak. I was missing my friends and i was sexually frustrated as I didn't get the alone time I needed because everyone was at home.  plus then my grandfather fell sick and died last December which was painful to me because i always loved and admired him and ever since then everything went down hill. after December January came and COVID cases in India began to decline and There was rumor that schools might reopen for final examinations to be held offline.

i had not studied the entire 11th grade and now i had to give my examinations offline and i started a very fucked up sleep schedule and  i still didn't prepare well for chemistry. so i failed chemistry and the day before i received the news of failing chemistry the only problem that i faced was that i was not able to sleep because of anxiety and the feeling of falling that it gives keeping me awake but that day my life started to get fucked up even more because i had a shoot up in my anxiety levels and i was already sick and tired due to the poor sleep schedule so that day i had severe dizziness and nausea that messed me up good.

then the worst happened the dizziness took over my life i am a tall guy who stands 6'1 feet(183.5cm ) tall so my poor posture due to all the screen time lack of sleep and lack of exercise plus anxiety and stress gave me the worst few months of my life where i lived in constant fear as the second wave hit being at home became a burden it felt like an asylum and i was sick of my home.

and since i am now in the last year of school all the tests and the burden of getting a good college have been killing me i am constantly depressed and sad about my life i am irritated by my poor health and even now i am not fully recovered mentally. i have had several suicidal thoughts and i can't take this anymore. I can't go into details how hard it has become to live life I'm just cutting through the days of my late teens in pain.

i miss my old health my old self i miss my old life and i don't know how long i can take this on for. i wrote to reddit so that i can get some help and motivation as i have no one to talk to who will understand me.

mentalhealth,ttap0v,2022-04-01 03:19:46,"Hey everyone, I (28f) am at my wits end and could use some help. For some background, I was very ill with covid-19 beginning of January 2022. I’m fully vaccinated and also had a very mild case in Aug of 2021. I haven’t felt the same since and I’ve been experiencing brain fog, chest pains, worsened asthma, and anxiety. I was having high heart rates so recently my PCP had me wear a cardiac halter monitor that showed a lot of PVCs and even short runs of ventricular tachycardia. So far the rest of my tests have come back normal and I have an echo coming up. 

I have a history of depression, OCD, PTSD, and anxiety that was very well controlled with an SSRI and therapy. I was even able to taper off my SSRI in 2020 and had been doing well for the first time in my life. 

About a month ago I took a steroid pack for my asthma that sent me into a mental tailspin and worsened the panic attacks I’d been having since covid. I experienced mild psychosis and wasn’t able to function on my own and had to take a LOA from work. My PCP prescribed Klonopin (which I use sparingly) and I’ve improved slightly but I’m still experiencing extreme anxiety and OCD behaviors. Nearly every waking moment I’m plagued with obsessive thoughts about my health and VIVID mental scenarios surrounding my potential death. I cannot drop the thought until I walk myself through the scenario and go through how I would treat myself if I was my patient.

I can not seem to stop checking my heart rate/blood pressure and do it approx 50-100x a day. My medical knowledge tells my rational brain that I’m fine but my anxiety has convinced me that I’m missing something and cannot do anything to save myself from dying. I even find myself googling the simplest medical questions in an attempt to visually convince myself I’m fine. To no avail.

I eventually have to return to work and don’t want to do so because I cannot risk a mistake.

I’ve tried every technique I can think of to ease my anxiety/fear but nothing is working. Living like this is excruciating, it feels like being boiled alive. My thoughts have become darker and I’m afraid I’ll break. Thank you for reading this as I know it was long. ANY advice, positive thoughts, or ideas are welcome. ♥️

mentalhealth,fk9jxh,2020-03-17 23:16:43,"Hi Everyone,

This is a difficult time for many people, whether they have mental health issues or not.  I've noticed several people posting and asking about how to deal with the isolation/lack of being able to socialize during this time.  If you are also dealing with depression, keeping yourself isolated can be even harder, no matter where you are in your recovery process.  So here are a few ideas to help you through the tough times, and hopefully help you deal with isolation.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Keep (or start) a routine of some kind, even if it has to be amended due to closures and cancellations. Get up at the same time, eat at the same time, schedule activities for yourself, go to bed at the same time, etc. Schedules can help reduce stress, help us keep our focus, spread our activities over each day, so that we aren't over loaded one day, and under scheduled another day, and helps us stay organized.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.  As I mentioned, I have been seeing others post about this concern about the isolation related to the virus, so have a scroll through the other posts, and comment to some one else who is in the same boat, saying 'hi', chat and see if you have something in common, or like the same sport, or music, or books, or some small connection, and then keep in touch and/or 'chat' with the others on this sub. Maybe people can all make some new online friends that need some socialization to feel a bit better during this tough time.  I get it is different than real life, but it's at least a little way you could try and get some socialization.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

\-

Here is a list of ideas of things to do to try and keep busy that I am copying here, as well as some relaxation techniques to consider trying----

\-

jig saw puzzles (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

crossword puzzle books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

word search books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

paint by numbers sets (not sure if you can do this online or not)

playing cards

drawing pictures

colouring books and crayons/colouring pencils (sounds juvenile, but colouring can be very relaxing and a good distraction technique)

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

do some chores around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder & lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

yoga

light scented candles/incense (relaxing)

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, it is quite fun and mesmorizing)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

smell some flowers

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

\-

\- There is also another Reddit sub that has a lot of good information, maybe check it out for further suggestions. It's called [r/SelfCareCharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfCareCharts/)

\-

\-

Here are some types of Relaxation techniques you could try-----

**Relaxation techniques----** (I prefer # 2 & 3; it does take practise, one or two times won't do much)----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes—just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.

\-

\-

\- Hope you can find something in these suggestions that may be of help, even just a little bit.  Keep trying every day, don't give up, one small step is a good step.  Good luck to you all! Take good care of yourselves.

mentalhealth,ta1awe,2022-03-09 11:40:27,"Growing up i never experienced anything related to panic or anxiety attacks but the same year COVID started I had my first experience which was super confusing to me considering the facts that I’ve never had one before in my life and having one for the first time not knowing what to expect really shocked me. Every since I’ve had that first experience I kept having it more often for things I used to normally just get a little anxious before and nothing would happen but now when I get anxious I start sweating, heart beats a lot faster, this fear inside of me takes over like I’m in a horror movie, I even get light headed or want to cry right away. And I would get like this over things I never got this way about in the past! So I was so confused and just so sad that I didn’t and still don’t feel like my normal self who used to never worry about things and get this way about it. My first experience was at work, I’m young and I had a lot of energy and patience within myself so I would always be taking on challenges at work and try to be fast not calling for back up cause I was telling myself I got this no worries just taking on the stress all on my own. And I guess I pushed my body and mind to a limit and one day I had so many people I needed to help and me being me at the time didn’t bother anyone and tried to take the responsibility on my own. But as soon as I saw all the people and got nervous I got so light headed and felt so nervous even scared. I asked to leave and someone took over for me but since then I wasn’t the same. I work in retail so you know, people call off or we are sometimes short staffed and sometimes we have to do multiple things at the same time. It happened again but it was worse, I got nervous just thinking about it happening again at work and I guess thinking about it triggered it again with the same scenario. I had a group of people to help and my heart was beating to fast, this time I couldn’t breathe I felt short of air, my hands started shaking and I wanted to cry. I called for help and just tried to relax in the restroom but in the beginning when it would happen it was really hard to come back down from it. It would give me this horrible migraines afterwards that lasted all day and I had to go home. When It got really bad is when it started interfering with my personal life outside of work where it started. Now I couldn’t eat in front of people or in crowds. A key point in all this that I’ve realized is when I got nervous at work it was because of the group of people LOOKING AT ME as they’re waiting in line for me to help them. And when I went to a restaurant where it was full of people or just even too close to a table with a bigger group of people. And I make eye contact with one of them or anything similar to that I panic and I can’t eat now. I’ll feel like I’m choking on my food and if I feel like I’m starting to panic with food in my mouth I need to get it out or else I’ll want to gag or throw up. It’s still so hard to eat in public or sometimes at home, I’m only comfortable enough to eat in front of people I’ve known my whole life like my family or my best friend I’ve known since 6th grade. But other people like my boyfriend who at the time we had just started dating or friends or even coworkers I can’t eat in front it’s so hard. I haven’t tried and medication because I wanted to try to work on it on my own like breathing techniques when I feel nervous to calm myself down or I’ll sing a song in my head to distract my mind and forgot that I was panicking a second ago. Which is starting to help I haven’t had a serious panic attack for a good while now but I do usually get the feeling of it trying to rile up on me so I stop and breathe or drink water get something cold to cool myself down and especially remove myself from the situation that’s making me panic. I’m talking about this now because I’ve never really talked a doctor about it cause once I decided I was going to see someone about it I started to be able to take control over it especially with the help of my best friend who’s always dealt with panic attacks in her teenage years so she gave me a lot of advice and help. But I am pregnant now and just want to have a good pregnancy with no issues or have to worry about panicking while pregnant especially when going into labor considering it’s my first child. I have yet to see a doctor soon since I just found out about my pregnancy but I wanted to see if anyone out there has had any similar experience like mine and what It was like for you. My perspective changed a lot once I started dealing with this panic attacks because I’ve always been understanding even if I didn’t actually understand whats going or what they’re feeling since my best friend has dealt with this for years, but once I got an experience of my own first hand I told her “wow you used to feel this too??”. So we never know what one person goes through on a daily basis and the kind of battles they have to face at times like for example mine not being able to eat in front of people. I still battle with it but I didn’t quit, I still try hoping that someday in being able to eat confidently in restaurants or in front of family/friends without having to ask my boyfriend to stop by somewhere to get some food after saying I’m not hungry with family/friends because I was too scared to eat and think I’d panic while trying to enjoy my pancakes lol any advice or even sharing your experience could help.",growing never experienced anything related panic anxiety attacks year covid started first experience super confusing considering facts never one life one first time knowing expect really shocked every since first experience kept often things used normally get little anxious nothing would happen get anxious start sweating heart beats lot faster fear inside takes like horror movie even get light headed want cry right away would get like things never got way past confused sad still feel like normal self used never worry things get way first experience work young lot energy patience within would always taking challenges work try fast calling back cause telling got worries taking stress guess pushed body mind limit one day many people needed help time bother anyone tried take responsibility soon saw people got nervous got light headed felt nervous even scared asked leave someone took since work retail know people call sometimes short staffed sometimes multiple things time happened worse got nervous thinking happening work guess thinking triggered scenario group people help heart beating fast time breathe felt short air hands started shaking wanted cry called help tried relax restroom beginning would happen really hard come back would give horrible migraines afterwards lasted day go home got really bad started interfering personal life outside work started eat front people crowds key point realized got nervous work group people looking waiting line help went restaurant full people even close table bigger group people make eye contact one anything similar panic eat feel like choking food feel like starting panic food mouth need get else want gag throw still hard eat public sometimes home comfortable enough eat front people known whole life like family best friend known since 6th grade people like boyfriend time started dating friends even coworkers eat front hard tried medication wanted try work like breathing techniques feel nervous calm sing song head distract mind forgot panicking second ago starting help serious panic attack good usually get feeling trying rile stop breathe drink water get something cold cool especially remove situation making panic talking never really talked doctor cause decided going see someone started able take control especially help best friend always dealt panic attacks teenage years gave lot advice help pregnant want good pregnancy issues worry panicking pregnant especially going labor considering first child yet see doctor soon since found pregnancy wanted see anyone similar experience like mine like perspective changed lot started dealing panic attacks always understanding even actually understand whats going feeling since best friend dealt years got experience first hand told wow used feel never know one person goes daily basis kind battles face times like example mine able eat front people still battle quit still try hoping someday able eat confidently restaurants front without ask boyfriend stop somewhere get food saying hungry scared eat think panic trying enjoy pancakes lol advice even sharing experience could help

In the past, mental health hadn’t been a subject of concern for me but since going through the lockdown my stress and anxiety became a problem.

Now that lockdown has I feel more calm, however at points in time when I am alone in my room, I tend to be more prone to stress and anxiety than I used to be.

mentalhealth,nbx0ds,2021-05-14 06:56:09,"I have an adverse fear of needles. It has been caused by several traumatic experiences involving needles in the past. Let me tell you about some of them. (I have Asperger’s syndrome also if that makes a difference)

As a kid (I think I was in 4th grade) I needed a cavity in my tooth filled. I had a dentist that my whole family has gone to for years with no issues. I trusted the doctor fully, as that had been my first time needing my teeth to be worked on. When the doctor injected the numbing medication, I had an intense pain in the side of my mouth, which lingered for roughly 10 days. After a day passed it bruised and my face was swollen so bad I couldn’t talk for about 10 days. 

The next experience was when I was entering middle school. I needed to get some vaccinations in order to advance to the middle school from elementary. One of them was the tetanus shot. I was deathly afraid of it due to my previous dentist incident (which would have only been like a year before.) Everyone kept trying to dismiss my fear and was telling me that I wouldn’t even feel it, etc. I had to be held down by two other nurses in order for the third nurse to be able to administer it. It was just as painful as I was anticipating, I’m not sure if that was my brain making it worse than it really is or what, but it is definitely number 2 on my history of most painful events I’ve experienced. (Number 1 being the previously mentioned dentist incident.) I have never received an injection of any kind since then.

I’m 20 years old now and I am SICK AND TIRED of the COVID restrictions. Not to mention that my father went on this big tangent about how the mRNA vaccines change your DNA. Honestly I had two motivators to want to get the vaccine: to spite my dad and to get closer to the finish line of COVID restrictions. Long story short I made an appointment and I chickened out because of the previous traumatic experiences I had. People keep telling me that they didn’t even feel the needle etc. They lied to me the last two times I needed an injection, why is this gonna be different? And if the first shot IS painful enough that I don’t get the 2nd shot, then the whole thing was a waste. I’m kind of at a loss for what to do.

mentalhealth,rufhj4,2022-01-02 23:42:21,"Hello, even though we don't know each other, I need to vent something before my mental health goes off the rail. It has been almost 2 years since the pandemic and lockdown.  But as time goes on and on, vaccines are now available with over 60% of the American population. I feel like there is one major thing that needs to be MORE talked along with the pandemic is mental health. Lots of people had depression and anxiety when lockdown was in place, but our mental health ""was getting better"" with vaccines and cases dying down for a good bit, but a majority of us still has this one little problem called ""overthinking"". I will say that being concerned about loved ones with the pandemic, but there's also overthinking the pandemic. As time when on, we know what to do while living through the pandemic, always wear your mask, social distance and if you're vaccinated, you can ease up a bit. But other people like to overthink a lot, especially with new variants. Recently, with the news about the Omicron variant spreading across the US but with evidence about the variant being mostly mild and less severe than the Delta variant, we don't want to worry that much, but one person in my family had different thoughts about it. Not listening to the news thoroughly and overthinking what the doctors are saying, he automatically assumed that we should be in lockdown. I told him to calm down, and I told him that we don't to be on lockdown and that when we go outside we can be more careful. His tone was very panicky, and he was about 20 seconds away from having an anxiety attack. This is what happens when people overthink, it really has a long-term effect in the future, and it's not a good thing for our mental health. I wish the news talks about how problematic it is to overthink about the pandemic because with that precautions we take, it won't change the fact that the pandemic is still going on and yes there will be new variants, but at  the end of the day, we know what to do to not just keep ourselves safe but to keep others safe.

I personally find that somehow it makes it easier to hear about all the generations before that went through similar difficulties. So, I thought I would share the following hoping it inspires someone else:

""The fact remains that none of this is easy. Despite your masks and sachets, the vinegar and the protective clothing, despite the calmness of your courage and tireless effort, the day will come when you can no longer bear this city of dying people, the crowd that turns in circles along its dusty, scorching hot streets, their cries, their terror that knows no future. The day will come when you will want to shout out your disgust in the face of everyone’s pain and fear. When that day comes, there will no longer be any solution I can offer, other than compassion, which is the sister of ignorance.""

I live in the UK where all lockdown restrictions are currently lifted. I live with my family and will continue to for at least the next 12 months for financial reasons. 

My family and I are all double vaccinated but my family are still very concerned about the pandemic and very concerned that one of us will catch Covid. Because of this, I feel enormous pressure from my family to not go out and meet people (although they're not physically stopping me at all). This pressure is giving me so much anxiety that I don't even want to bother meeting or interacting with anyone, which is really taking a toll on my mental health.

What should I do? Without their jabs, my parents would be vulnerable, so I understand their concern but at the end of the day we can't live like this forever and it's not a reasonable expectation on me to live like it's still April 2020.

A little background: 
I have always been paranoid since the pandemic started. I get anxious everytime I think of covid. Cleaning has taken up most of my day, to the point where I have to wash my hands and use rubbing alcohol even though I didn't touch anything. It became so bad that my hands are covered with rashes. I spray too much disinfectant that I got asthma, it's literally so bad but I couldn't stop. I don't know but I think I might have developed OCD (not medically diagnosed)

I'm currently living with my girlfriend and her family for a couple of months now since we started our business together. Her dad currently tested positive for covid and now we're in isolation since we are all close contacts. I feel like I'm going crazy because this is my first time to get exposed and to live with someone who is covid positive. I have always been cautious, I never met up with friends unless they take a test and it shows up negative. (Ofcourse I'm the one who pays for the test) Otherwise, I won't. I think I just went out less than 10 times during this pandemic. 

So to the main point -- When we got the news that her dad is positive, I broke down, I was so stressed that it felt like my head was going to explode. I cried for the whole night. My girlfriend knew how paranoid and stressed I was but I felt like she doesn't take me seriously. And just a while ago, she told me how crazy I was and how she wanted to be alone. She told me countless times that she was not scared because we both got our boosters and I'm the only who's scared like crazy. I couldn't even clean in front of her now because I'm scared what her reaction might be. I mean... I don't know. I'm really stressed right now that I couldn't function properly. I'm so drained.

It’s sucking on many levels. I live with two close friends but obviously they both need to isolate from me in an attempt to not catch it from me. 

I seem to have a really fun symptom where my eyes hurt if I move them too much and generally just hurt, especially when there’s bright lights/screens involved. So online communication is a struggle too.

I went on a call with some friends tonight but one of them is also ill. I saw them at a party over a week ago and over the past few days they’ve had a sore throat and started coughing. They’re nervous that they’ve also got COVID and me being me, I’ve apologised in advance if I did give them anything but I also said I’m fairly certain I know who gave me COVID and I would have gotten it after seeing them. Can’t be sure until they get their PCR back though.

Still, they kept saying how they saw their elderly and immuno-compromised relatives after that party and I know they’re just worried but the guilt was heavy. 

And I just don’t feel like I can communicate properly atm, and I can see myself already falling into a spiral of “I’m not being positive so no one wants me around”. I want to defiantly say I know that’s not the case but I struggle to believe it. 

I know I’ve been ill for a while now (had at least two other illnesses before this one without pause) and I know they’re probably sick of hearing about it from me but I don’t know what to do.

But today her sister came down with a temperature and headache, and she has taken one lateral flow test that was immediately positive. And another. And then three more. All positive.

mentalhealth,r6ofkh,2021-12-02 02:03:54,"Hello Redditors, I am a PhD student from University at Buffalo. Our research team wants to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health among high school students. 

If you are a current high school student or a high school graduate in Class of 2021, could you help us by filling out a survey? Here is the link to the survey:  [https://redcap.link/covid19mhhss](https://redcap.link/covid19mhhss)  This survey includes five sections: general information, education and school life, infection and quarantine status, health-related behaviors, and mental health, and takes about 10-15 minutes.  

If you are under 18 years old,  we will need your parents to click the link, indicate their consent, and then they will receive the link for you to complete the survey via email. The beginning of the survey has clearly introduced the whole process, and you and your parents can easily do it on the web page without any external help. 

We want to investigate the mental health status among high school students because we found that younger adults aged 18-26 were more vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes during the pandemic when we conducted a similar study among adults. Given that adolescents are a more vulnerable population, we conducted this study in order to better understand the mental health issues in this population and provide scientific evidence for better control of the mental health impact of COVID-19 for this group. This survey would be one of the first studies to examine the effects of the prolonged pandemic, which is now considered a chronic stressor, on the mental health of adolescents. 

 Sufficient responses are very important for us to address our research question and draw a valid conclusion.  However, since we do not have enough sources to reach out to them, many parents/students do not know our study and therefore cannot participate in it. If possible, could you share this survey with other relevant people?

Thank goodness I didn't have it bad and I've since fully recovered, but that isolation period did a number on my mental health. Ever since I've been feeling really detached from everything and everyone. It's really something that makes you feel alone. 

I'm extremely fortunate for my mother though, who did the absolute most in caring for during this time, going above and beyond, and I can never repay her. But even though I'm physically fine now and I've rejoined the world, I can't seem to shake this feeling of loneliness and detachment. I can sit in a room filled with friends and family and still feel like I'm by myself. I don't know how else to describe it, it just sucks.

My best explanation for why I feel like this is because my world sort of came to a standstill, while the rest of the world carries on. But rejoining the world can be a little overwhelming, and now I just feel detached, separated and alone. I'm an introvert and generally spend most of my time in solitude.

That on its own is problematic, but right now it's especially problematic because one of the possible side-effects of the Covid vaccine is nausea and vomiting. Yet I know I need to get the vaccine, for my own safety as well as the safety of all those around me. But what can I do? I'm scared to get it if there's a chance it might make me nauseous or throw up. Both my parents are fully vaccinated which I'm really happy for, and my dad had no real problems but my mom had a bad reaction to it. She was really tired and didn't feel well, and she ended up throwing up once or twice because of it. We called the doctor and he said that vomiting was sorta rare but nothing to really worry about. So we kept an eye on her and by the next day she was pretty much better, though it took a few more days for her to fully recover and get her energy back. I've heard women are more likely to be affected by side effects than men, and younger people in general are more likely to be affected because their immune systems are stronger. 

I'm a 24 year old woman and have half my mother's DNA (obviously, because she's my mom) so I'm terrified that when I get my first or second shot of the vaccine I'll be nauseous and throw up too! Isn't there any way I can prevent this? I've heard of anti-emetics, medication that's supposed to keep people from throwing up and they give it to people after surgery, but I don't think that's something I can just buy over the counter or ask a doctor to give me. Plus I'm on antidepressants (for depression and anxiety) and I don't know if there would be any interactions. I wonder if the type of vaccine makes a difference?

mentalhealth,o475f2,2021-06-20 20:11:05,"Hey you there read this for a sec. Wherever you may be, in whatever country you’re in I’m sure you had to go through quarantines and curfews and lockdowns etc... now the world is slowly opening up again thanks to vaccinations, gatherings are once again legal, bars and restaurants are opening. And the thing is, like we had to transition into this long Covid lockdown period and change our way of life, we also have to transition back out which is again, changing how we live. For some people it’s easy and for some it’s a little more tough. From conversations I’ve had with people, many have felt an obligation to constantly socialize, especially because it’s summer, go out to bars/restaurants, see many people, drink etc because we’ve been deprived of it for so long, to the point where every spare moment they have, if not working/studying, they spend it doing exactly that, taking a tole on their mental health. Many, including myself, have experienced social anxiety, and that, especially with restaurants/ bars, our eating, drinking and sleeping habits also change, affecting our physical and mental health, how we feel physically and/or we see ourselves with body image because they are habits different from our lockdown phase. I can say my body image is at an all time low. Drinking a lot and eating out because socializing now revolves around that mdamaged how I see and feel about myself. I have gained weight and lost all confidence in myself within these past two month. This week I realised my life was waking up, working, coming home, immediately hanging with people then going to sleep and starting again. No alone time and what happened? I broke down really hard and in the words of Bo Burnham, I feel like shit.

The point I’m trying to make is, yes it’s amazing that we can start to socialize more again also because it’s summer but also remember to not force yourself to go out if you don’t want to, to take time for yourself too when you need it. If you don’t feel like seeing people or partying or drinking or going to a restaurant, it is NOT an obligation just because stuff opened up again. If you do then go for it of course go crazy go have fun! But also wanting to not go out and doing something else is just as sexy #selfcare. You’re allowed to go on a run instead of going out or staying in and watching a show or leave a party early because you just feel like it’s what you need. Listen to your body and be honest with yourself, everybody is different so you do you. Watch out for your friends too and make sure they know they are allowed to do that.

This year and a half were so rough for me as university student. My grades plummeted, I couldn't fall asleep at night, got out of shape, missed seeing all my friends and my overall routine. I felt so horrible.

The whole year I've been looking forward to the summer, when everybody would get vaccinated and everything would be allright again. I went totally out of my way to get my first vaccine shot early enough, so I would be able to go on summer camp as head camp counselor. It matched perfectly ,we should depart just exactly 14 days after my second shot, which was the exact period, needed for total protection. I did multiple allnighters to make sure everything was arraged perfectly for this camp and i've put all my heart and soul to create the most creative camp games I've ever made.  

Yesterday afternoon two other camp counselors and  I went to gather all materials needed for all the camp activities. We all got tested in the morning, just to be sure, because testing wasn't obligated anymore. But to be extra save, we allways kept our masks on, disinfected our hands all the time and we always respected the 1,5 meters distance rule. Everyting went great and we were so thrilled to go!

Today one of my fellow counselors texted me she tested positive and she had contacted the contact tracing team to mention the names of everyone she had met the previous days. She also mentioned our names, but forgot to mention that we kept everything totally covid proof. Next, I got a call from the covid contact tracing team with the order to stay in obligated quarantine for the next 10 days, so did my fellow head counselor. We both tried to explain that there wasn't any high risk contact that day and we followed all the rules because without the two head conselors, the whole camp could be cancelled. But they already put our names into the register and wouldn't change it how hard we tried to prove that we weren't in the wrong here. 

Now I'm sitting at home, in forced isolation, devestated because the whole year I've been looking forward to this and even worse: all these kids will probably not be able to go on summer camp tomorrow, because of the lack of camp counselors.

I'm also bulimic and stopped purging once we got the positive result. Maybe that's why I'm getting these symptoms?

Today is a dark day for my extended family. My uncle sadly passed away due to multiple complications following a coronavirus infection. 

I'd been honestly enjoying this lockdown since it started in my country. Being an introvert by nature, I got so much time to enjoy my hobbies and connect with friends over the phone I've not been able to talk for a long time because of my otherwise busy schedule.

But then this happened. God knows we've tried our best to arrange for the best doctors, the best treatments, plasma when required. A week of something bad happening, then that getting rectified, followed by something else worse. One thing led to the other, and the all money, all the medical expertise we could arrange for, all went to vain. 

My uncle was not really at fault: he had contacted the virus himself while helping out others in his family. He had been a fit, middle-aged man with no history of medical conditions. My mom often used to tell me about his love of academics, having fetched multiple degrees across diverse fields. This comes as a shock to everyone, especially my cousins who have lost their father and my aunt, who has lost her husband. How should I get over it, and what could I do to help my family?

Some sound advice (esp. mental health professionals, if any) could go a long way.

I have so many things I want to do but I don't feel any pleasure anymore so I have no motivation to do anything. I can no longer feel my body, and I am ""zoned out"" 24/7. I literally went from being a carefree kid that was happy most of the time to this shell of a human being. It's been more than  3 years, im 20 now, and it hasn't gotten even 0.01% better.

The only thing that helps me are compression socks, but even that causes me to only go from 5% to 15%. I would consider myself a very disciplined person but willpower is not enough to make me want to do anything without any pleasure or reward. I don't even watch shows or read anymore. I used to pass every subject in school with ease, now I have almost failed 3 courses despite the content being way easier than highschool.

I don't have any mental illness but it doesn't matter. No matter what I think or do the brainfog remains. I used to love playing competitive video games, and I would get to the top 0.1% in every game I played. My dream was to become a professional player, and I was genuinely close. Now I can't even get past the top 40% no matter how much effort I put in. I'm giving myself 2, maybe 2 and a half years. If I can't fix my problems by then, I'm jumping off a bridge.

SuicideWatch,1dqpgke,2024-06-28 23:08:09,"I'm 19M  and being a teenager during covid destroyed my mental health.

The pandemic started when I was in 9th grade. I was attending high school normally at first. Before the pandemic, in high school I had friends, I was in choir, I was in all honors classes, I wasn't getting straight A's but I got good grades. I would wake up early for school to shower and make sure I was put together. Everyday I'd wake up early for school. I was generally happy. I struggled to get homework done because of my ADHD, but I would do it sometimes at breakfast or when teachers gave us time at the end of class to do it. I wasn't popular, I experienced bullying because I'm autistic and queer, but I was still a confident, friendly, and sociable person. I was able to make good friends.

I had actual energy. I never struggled to stay in contact with friends. I went to school dances. I didn't go out much but there were times I'd go to the park with my friends and have an amazing time. I made a best friend. I had actual passions, I fell in love with kpop and Korean culture and started teaching myself Korean. I was passionate about choir and vocal music, I had an impressive singing range and could sing any part in treble choir. I felt truly comfortable in choir and that was the one place I never got bullied. I wanted to go to college to pursue vocal music.

When covid happened, my entire 10th grade was virtual. I tried at first. I logged into the zoom meetings, did the assignments, but after a while I started giving up. A lot of my friends didn't stay in contact with me, so I was spending most of my time in my room. I became lazy and completely unmotivated to do anything, and at this time it was okay because nothing else was expected of me (I wasn't told to get a job because my mom is on government housing and disability, my mom didn't want me to work while in high school because the government would raise the rent. She didn't make much from disability and didn't want me to have to pay rent for the shitty house we live in).

Now I'm completely unmotivated, lazy, unskilled, dumb, and I have no passions. I'm a NEET who's completely addicted to the internet. I've worked a little bit after high school but I absolutely despise work. I always ended up using my phone at work, taking longer breaks than I needed to, and always finding ways to slack off. I know it's a problem but I don't know how to stop. I've been to therapy, I've even been to the psych ward, I'm on antidepressants now, but I don't really know what's wrong with me. ADHD runs in my family, and I've never been treated for it. But, I guess my problem is laziness. But, I don't know where this laziness came from because I didn't used to be like this. I'm scared I'll end up homeless because I'm just too lazy and tired to work, I'm too dumb for work as well so even when I try I mess up. I don't know what else to do.

SuicideWatch,18u91ez,2023-12-30 11:58:27,"I got cut off from my own emotions, pleasure, and bodily sensation by taking 10mg of Prozac for six weeks and smoking a small amount of weed every other day. I smoked weed because a few people said it was fine, but I'm not like most people, I'm sensitive to substances and mixing the two eventually gave me low grade serotonin syndrome so I had to quit Prozac cold turkey and a month later I got PSSD.   


I have no sexual pleasure and my head feels like cement. I've been like this for four whole months now, going on month five. I had progress, I had changes, which is rare and lucky in the first months of PSSD and it looked like I was going to recover from it.  


Prozac made my toes go numb, but that healed mostly, but now the pins and needles feeling and the numbness is back after I had a mild, mostly asymptomatic case of covid. But that can still do damage to the vascular and nervous system.  


Today, I tried to draw. I am 70k in debt to an art school. For years I haven't been able to work and make things happen for myself because of debilitating ADHD. I can't make my hands do the right thing and I can't picture what I want to do. The results of my effort look so stupid and ugly, it's like how I drew in high school before I got my fancy art school education. It's like my brain forgot how to draw. I can't hold images in my head either.   


There's a really long story about how I even started taking Prozac and it involves a manic episode from an SNRI I was taking for ADHD (I can't have stimulants because of ulcerative colitis), antipsychotics I shouldn't have had, and people convincing me I had brain damage from it. The antipsychotic made my OCD worse again so I decided to treat it and whoops, it got me PSSD.   


Everywhere I turn with PSSD I find highly pessimistic people and permanent PSSD cases that scare the shit out of me. Covid made my symptoms worse and I never read about people bouncing back from having covid while having PSSD. If my toes are going numb again, that means I have nerve damage in them and covid repdamaged my nerves there, and it also probably re-damaged the nerves in my genitals too. It's not going to heal right, I never even expected it to heal perfectly at all because I'm on an immunosuppressant that slows nerve healing and generally fucks with nerves a little bit.   


I don't want to live with numb genitals and no emotions and no pleasure for the rest of my life. What's the point of living? I don't have children, I don't have anyone to live FOR, all I had were pleasures I can no longer enjoy to keep me going. I wanted to start dating this year until my ability to feel romantic love and have sex left me. I'm almost 30, queer, and I forced myself to come out to the parents I live with only this year.   


I haven't wanted to die since 2019. I cured my depression with shrooms back then, I just had OCD. I felt so good this time last year, the Straterra was working, I was almost done with my portfolio, and it all just collapsed because I had a manic episode and went to the world's shitties mental hospital, delusional that nazis were going to kill me there and I didn't have a therapist to talk to there so I took invega sustenna so I could go home. Biggest mistake of my fucking life. Taking Prozac to ""heal the damage"" was an even bigger mistake, I'm sure I would feel close to normal by now or at least able to have a normal orgasm.   


I was a deeply emotional, loving person who really cared about the world. Now I feel nothing, my life is slipping through my fingers like sand, I'm never going to make it as an artist now. On top of that, I can't feel my cunt. I was perfectly sexually functional, I would have been a great lay, but I only had sex with a friend once and it didn't go the way I wanted it to. Tragic.   


I feel like I already died, why shouldn't I just fucking end it? I lived with untreated ADHD and a chronic illness for years (the colitis just started to get better and I no longer have chronic pain, ha, I would be feeling GREAT if I didn't have PSSD) and now I'm stuck with a humiliating iatrogenic disorder that robbed me of every ounce of artistic passion and skill, now I really CAN'T use my overpriced education. The only thing stopping me is not having a method and the frozen ground, and having friends who would miss me. I want a green burial and I'm not going to keep in a morgue unembalmed over the winter.   


I want it all to end. I want my life back, I want my soul back, I want my perfect they/them WAP back. But I keep finding a dearth of hope for it, I'm so scared I'm going to be stuck like this for the rest of my shitty, stupid life.

SuicideWatch,14k4ped,2023-06-27 11:10:16,"It’s a rough anniversary for me (June 26) because a year ago today I was sick and couldn’t breathe (later learned it was Covid) and as I lay in bed I felt the presence of beings coming to collect my soul, to take me away. I wasn’t previously religious and I’d never had a spiritual experience before. I had long Covid symptoms—namely it induced asthma that went untreated for months and some bizarre episodes of paranoia. I went deep into long Covid communities and advocacy and saw the stories of people who have it the worst. I got unbelievably lucky. I can do everything I did before as long as I take my inhalers and my neurologist says relapse is “highly unlikely.” But because I know how many people are bedridden and unable to tolerate any amount of stimulation, that is the worst fear I‘ve ever had. I know this will happen to me if I get Covid again. I really want to go back to college and even conduct scientific research into long Covid. But I‘ll become permanently bedridden, too sick to kill myself, just a prisoner in my body for the next several decades.

A couple days ago the American Lung Association in my state made a really anodyne post acknowledging that air pollution exists. Someone in the comments said something like “We all survived Covid, we can handle a little dust.” Because I had Covid, my lungs couldn’t handle a little dust for the longest time. But what this comment really made me realize is that I wish I hadn’t survived it. I wish I had died a year ago today when they came to collect my soul and I fought them because I was too young. If I had just slipped off into the abyss that night it would have saved me so much suffering. My parents talk as if I‘ll graduate from college and live a long life. But I know that one more infection will incapacitate me forever. I’m already on enough prescribed drugs to tranquilize a horse. Today I took 5 Benadryls to try to sleep through this rough anniversary (not a suicide attempt) and I didn’t fall asleep.

Every night i lay for hours tossing and turning get tremors and internal vibrations and twitching never feeling comfortable any more and if i do happen to doze off I have bizarre dreams sometimes nightmares but its like im aware im dreaming very hard to explain. The head pressure/pain 24/7 is becoming unbearable and nothing seems real anymore I believe its derealization/depersonalization or dissociation. I have sensitivity to lights and sounds now it gets overwhelming in places like stores now also my smell has seem to be altered like its more sensitive

I also now also have a feeling of being on edge seemingly stuck in flight or fight mode. Anxious feeling in my stomach all the time and constantly thinking of how awful I feel. I never tested positive for covid or even felt sick but i think I might have had an asymptomatic infection possibly because from what i read all the symptoms seem on par with long covid especially with it being written off as anxiety, I never really have been anxious or depressed before or not anymore than most people but now severely so

All of this started happening seemingly over night and I can't take not feeling like myself and the constant head pain. Ive been to Dr's and at first they tried to say it was anxiety but i know there's no way all of this could just be anxiety. Recently ive been to a neuro and have some migraine meds ive been trying for the head pain but they don't work and im not entirely sure its an actual migraine because its been almost 4 months now

I can't enjoy anything anymore eating, sex, even watching tv or reading, Video games were my only hobby really and now if i try to play the head pressure intensifies

SuicideWatch,130wkyy,2023-04-27 22:31:47,"Before I go onto my issue I want to make it clear I'm currently passive on this thought, and I am trying my best to seek help before it worsens.  


My life wasn't always like this. I used to be a great guy in social circles. People would always talk to me, I would feel like I contributed something. I was one of the popular kids in class from 4th to 7th grade (albeit it was just because I was naughty and loved to be a prankster; but still, that didn't stop me from being great friends with a lot of people. Even on the Internet I used to be active a lot; I regularly participated in activities as well. No problems. Just a happy life. I even excelled at hobbies, like cycling, going outside, playing certain sports (I still kind of hate football), and games like chess. Until of course, COVID-19 had to ruin it.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to post-COVID era, right after online classes stopped being a reality. I was excited to meet everyone back at school, and to finally meet some people irl and not behind a screen, but this is where all the problems began. For starters, my social skills went down to 0. Back when I used to be the guy who made the first advance in a conversation, now I suddenly became the guy who would just listen and not even have his opinion considered seriously. Back when people used to laugh at my presence, now they just cringe at me and from their looks, it seems they just wished they never met me in the first place. The very same people in 7th grade now seemed to forget I used to exist among them; they would talk, they would play, they would pull off pranks. Whenever I decided to get included, I felt like I was this big burden on them; that they just wished they wouldn't have to carry this sob around for their time. Outside school as well, this was a big issue. Apart from my cousin, almost no one really felt like they were in a mood to converse with me. My social anxiety grew as a result. It felt as if no one apart from my cousin and my family really wished to be with me anymore. It was like, the world just forgot I existed. Whenever during events like marriages and ceremonies I would try my best to socialize, but my anxiety of trying to not be a burden just made me look like a creep. It felt like I was 'stalking' them to an extent. I was always afraid of being viewed as a mere stalker and not the same old pal who used to play pranks during Maths Period at school. 10th grade has just finished, and most of the students in my class have left for other schools to pursue their senior secondary education. They even threw a farewell party for the entire class. I was not invited. I would like to believe it's just that 'they forgot', but given I spent 6 years with them, having 2 years being in online classes, I believe that's VERY VERY FAR away from the truth.

&#x200B;

Then, the Internet. Due to online classes I never really had a chance to contribute much to online communities, and this was where things truly began to spiral downward. Even when the person I was talking to was probably thousands of kilometres away from me and is behind a screen, I just felt like it was often just being a burden for them. Not to mention sometimes I would make a statement they wouldn't find funny (I already got banned from 2 Discord servers for this; I naturally developed a sense of dark humor during quarantine and it wasn't a popular thing among those places) and they would immediately make it clear they were not interested in that conversation. Thanks to my severe self-guilt, I would find myself being extremely depressed even over something like this which most people would forget within a day or two, and feel like it's just my fault. It just feels lonely, and I cannot just seem to fit in anywhere. The guy who I used to be 3 years ago; it seemed I wasn't that same guy. He could fit into anywhere and find himself to blend in nice with the people; meanwhile now I am just this, uninteresting emo kid who constantly finds himself to be on the verge of having a complete emotional breakdown.

&#x200B;

And don't even get me started on being productive. My interests in athletic activity have decreased SEVERELY (if you compare me to my 7th grade self, I would literally be a twig in comparison) and it just feels pursuing my hobbies is worthless. I recently got into game development; and sometimes I just wonder if this is all worth it because at the end of the day no one would really care about what I put forward. I just want to learn how to not give a F anymore; it just feels like this is getting to my mind where now I spend most of my days listening to depressing music like EATEOT, and just imagining myself in suicidal positions while doing so. Not to mention since my interests in dark humor and offensive memes have increased a bit to help me gain at least a laugh in these sober times, I've often been accused of being racist and homophobic, as well as being a 'bigot', it just hurts to be labelled as something you're clearly against, I do not support any form of discrimination, and I know it's not my problem people have such views about me either, but I can't stop beating myself for it. It just, absolutely ruins my mood, I know I'm not what they accuse me of, yet I feel guilty. And I cannot just stop thinking about it. 

&#x200B;

I would like any advice on how to deal with this, thanks.",go onto issue want make clear currently passive thought trying best seek help worsens life always like used great guy social circles people would always talk would feel like contributed something one popular kids class 4th 7th grade albeit naughty loved prankster still stop great friends lot people even internet used active lot regularly participated activities well problems happy life even excelled hobbies like cycling going outside playing certain sports still kind hate football games like chess course ruin x200b fast forward era right online classes stopped reality excited meet everyone back school finally meet people irl behind screen problems began starters social skills went back used guy made first advance conversation suddenly became guy would listen even opinion considered seriously back people used laugh presence cringe looks seems wished never met first place people 7th grade seemed forget used exist among would talk would play would pull pranks whenever decided get included felt like big burden wished would carry sob around time outside school well big issue apart cousin almost one really felt like mood converse social anxiety grew result felt one apart cousin family really wished anymore like world forgot existed whenever events like marriages ceremonies would try best socialize anxiety trying burden made look like creep felt like extent always afraid viewed mere stalker old pal used play pranks maths period school 10th grade finished students class left schools pursue senior secondary education even threw farewell party entire class invited would like believe forgot given spent 6 years 2 years online classes believe far away truth x200b internet due online classes never really chance contribute much online communities things truly began spiral downward even person talking probably thousands kilometres away behind screen felt like often burden mention sometimes would make statement would find funny already got banned 2 discord servers naturally developed sense dark humor quarantine popular thing among places would immediately make clear interested conversation thanks severe would find extremely depressed even something like people would forget within day two feel like fault feels lonely seem fit anywhere guy used 3 years ago seemed guy could fit anywhere find blend nice people meanwhile uninteresting emo kid constantly finds verge complete emotional breakdown x200b even get started productive interests athletic activity decreased severely compare 7th grade self would literally twig comparison feels pursuing hobbies worthless recently got game development sometimes wonder worth end day one would really care put forward want learn give f anymore feels like getting mind spend days listening depressing music like eateot imagining suicidal positions mention since interests dark humor offensive memes increased bit help gain least laugh sober times often accused racist homophobic well hurts labelled something clearly support form discrimination know problem people views either ca stop beating absolutely ruins mood know accuse yet feel guilty stop thinking x200b would like advice deal thanks
SuicideWatch,12jalcu,2023-04-12 10:28:05,"i wish it would kill me finally. 

people are so unfair. they dont even consider peoples health when scheduling social events. ive been wanting to be a shut in for a long time because i couldnt hold a job and all the family trips back and forth to the province made me sick. socializing makes me sick. 
ive been getting dizzy in long drives but i usually have to tag along instead of being left alone at home because my mom is afraid id kill myself. 

the last long drive was the longest, 13 1/2 hours on easter sunday. double the usual time. we visited relatives from holy thursday until sunday. and i had to participate in the good friday procession. my mom caught covid from one of her sisters who i am banned from seeing because im unvaccinated. we found out that my aunt had covid the day after we arrived home. this aunt played mah jongg at her house every day, even after one of her friends caught covid and they had to stop it for a while. 

mom took a self antigen test as soon as we found out. i was sitting beside her the whole ride home and she was already starting to feel sick then, so im sure i caught the bug 100%. been sick since monday. 

people never learn to reduce their social demands, even after the pandemic. another reminder why i want to withdraw from society as a whole. i wish theyd do more than ""sorry youre sick, take some meds"" and do more to prevent things that would lead to people getting sick. because mom and i are definitely not the only ones to spend 10+ in heavy traffic last sunday. im sure lots of other people got sick too. not to mention the pollution from all those cars. 

i dont usually mind traditions but when the conditions are that bad, then the tradition isnt worth it imho. imagine meeting with relatives for christmas and not being able to enjoy new years because of people getting sick during the holidays. 

i want to die. this world isnt worth living in and i dont have any more reasons to live. last night i was having a fever and a meltdown, and i lashed out at the person i love the most. what that person didnt know is that my whole life was flashing in front of my eyes right then and i felt all the hurts from before. 

i lost my bff of 6 years because he had a jealous girlfriend who wouldnt let him talk to exes. it was that easy for him to go no contact, after all ive done for him. he was a broken man when i found him and i built up his confidence. i proofread his works for publication and he won a national award. i helped him review for civil service and he passed. i taught him various things like card games, board games, interesting movies, and how to get steam. not to boast but i practically made that guy and now that gf reaps all the benefits. 

i know im unattractive and boring but i wish someone would stay when ive already devoted so much to them. im always afraid of losing the few friends i have now. and im afraid of getting too invested in someone or something just to fail miserably again, like my studies and work experiences. its so hard to commit to anything and my separation anxiety is through the roof lately. 

i want to be someones favorite person because thats the only thing that gives me a reason to live. everything else is fleeting, people come and go and i know i wont survive alone. im too weak to be alone, i dont have what it takes to take care of myself. so why cant i just die? im a burden and unwanted anyway. i didnt ask to exist. people are so unfair. life is so unfair.",wish would kill finally people unfair dont even consider peoples health scheduling social events ive wanting shut long time couldnt hold job family trips back forth province made sick socializing makes sick ive getting dizzy long drives usually tag along instead left alone home mom afraid id kill last long drive longest 13 hours easter sunday double usual time visited relatives holy thursday sunday participate good friday procession mom caught covid one sisters banned seeing im unvaccinated found aunt covid day arrived home aunt played mah jongg house every day even one friends caught covid stop mom took self antigen test soon found sitting beside whole ride home already starting feel sick im sure caught bug 100 sick since monday people never learn reduce social demands even pandemic another reminder want withdraw society whole wish theyd sorry youre sick take meds prevent things would lead people getting sick mom definitely ones spend heavy traffic last sunday im sure lots people got sick mention pollution cars dont usually mind traditions conditions bad tradition isnt worth imho imagine meeting relatives christmas able enjoy new years people getting sick holidays want die world isnt worth living dont reasons live last night fever meltdown lashed person love person didnt know whole life flashing front eyes right felt hurts lost bff 6 years jealous girlfriend wouldnt let talk exes easy go contact ive done broken man found built confidence proofread works publication national award helped review civil service passed taught various things like card games board games interesting movies get steam boast practically made guy gf reaps benefits know im unattractive boring wish someone would stay ive already devoted much im always afraid losing friends im afraid getting invested someone something fail miserably like studies work experiences hard commit anything separation anxiety roof lately want someones favorite person thats thing gives reason live everything else fleeting people come go know wont survive alone im weak alone dont takes take care cant die im burden unwanted anyway didnt ask exist people unfair life unfair

SuicideWatch,sewqig,2022-01-28 23:35:05,"I don’t know what to do anymore. I just found out on Monday that my boyfriend, the love of my life, passed away from covid. I can’t live with out him. He took care of me. He was always there for me. He was the whole reason I got up in the morning. The whole reason im even still alive. But now he’s gone. And I miss him so much. I just wanna hear his voice again. We never even met in person, but we were so in love. We were gonna meet. We were gonna get married. We were gonna spend our lives together. We planned out our whole future together. We were supposed to be together forever. We were perfect for each other. We were soulmates. Im a huge mess, and I just want to die. I was finally happy. And it’s just been ripped away from me. It feels like I was never meant to be happy. I was sexually and emotionally abused for a huge part of my childhood. But my boyfriend helped me. He saved me. He helped me report and get away from my abuser. He supported me and cared for me and was always there for me. He was so loving and caring. Fuck I miss him so bad. Ive been crying ever since I found out. And it just gets worse as the days go on. I wake up more depressed every day. More hopeless and devastated. I have no will to live anymore. He was my everything. My whole world. I’m so lost without him. I just talked to him last week. He died so suddenly. He had covid. But he promised he’d be okay. He promised. But then he just stopped responding. And I messaged one of his friends and that was it. They found him dead in his apartment. I didn’t even get to say goodbye. The last time we talked, I was just crying because I was so worried about him and all he kept saying was how much he loved me. And then I accidentally fell asleep and we got off call and he died later that day. I just don’t know what to do. I just want to hear his voice. His laugh. See his smile. The way he’d look at me. His silly jokes. He’s gone. I’m never gonna see him again. We’re never gonna get to do All the things we were supposed to do together, all the things we talked about and dreamed about. We’ll never do it. And I can’t deal with it. My therapist sent me to the ER on Tuesday because I had a huge meltdown when talking to her. And when I got there, I tested positive for covid. They can’t send me to a psychiatric hospital because I’m covid positive and I’m only sixteen so I can’t stay at the one in the hospital. I’m gonna be stuck here for days. I’m too high risk for suicide to send home. My life fucking sucks. I’m just rotting away in this hospital bed. All I want to do is hurt myself and die. I’m miserable. I’ve never felt this much pain in my entire life. I can’t stop crying. I miss him so bad. I love him so much. I love him more than anything and he’s gone. I can’t live without him. I’m done with life. I’ve had so much pain. All the abuse I’ve went through, and now this. he was the one thing that made things better. He made me so happy. Happier then I’d ever been in my entire life. He was the only one who understood me. The only one who was there for me during some of my abuse. But he’s fucking dead. I can’t stop thinking about him. Everything reminds me of him. Im already starting to forget his voice. I’m just done. I’m done trying. I’ve completely given up. Everyone has been saying it’ll get better. But I’ve heard that for almost seven years, and it just seems to get worse. I’m probably going to kill myself once I get out of the hospital. I already have a few ideas as to how. I’ve lost apart of myself. I lost the most important person in my life. The person I love the most. This feels like a bad dream. I wish I could wake up and he was still here. It hurts so bad. I’m so sad and miserable. So empty without him. I wish I could just sleep forever. I’ve always been depressed. I’ve always been fucked up. But he gave me hope. He loved me despite all my problems. He took care of me. I can’t take care of myself. Everyone keeps saying I have this sad look in my eyes, this weird face. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same. I just don’t know what to say anymore, what to do. My seventeenth birthday is in a two weeks, and I’m probably going to be spending it in the psych ward. I love you more than anything in the whole world, James. I love you so much. I never thought I’d lose you. It’s really hard. God it’s so hard. But it only hurts so much because I love you so much.  I really wish you could have held me in your arms just once. I can’t stop thinking about the fact that you died all by yourself. I should of been there next to you. You shouldn’t have died at all.

I miss your rambling about all the interesting things you know and like. I miss your face and your little tuffs of hair that would stick up against your headphones. I miss the way you’d smile. I miss the way you’d always cheer me up when I was sad. I miss all your little love poems and sappy love that just seemed to leak out of you. I miss your reassurance and your comfort. I miss the way you loved me and cared about me like no other. I love everything about you, and I miss everything about you. I’ll be seeing you soon as soon as I can.

SuicideWatch,udowvy,2022-04-28 12:19:02,"Throwaway acc. I wanna die. After 13 yrs in an eu country I'm still with only the student one year visa because my selfish bastard parents decided to have a second child 10 yrs ago. That decision changed everything. I was able to study well during the high school to get admitted into a very prestigious university, but since I had this stupid fucking brother and had to live with some relatives together to save money, i was unable to get any fee reductions. One year after i had to drop out and change the University to a public one, because of the growing pressure that my so called parents had been giving me. 

Really, i couldn't understand why they treated so badly during my high school years, beating, insulting and yelling at me every day, literally every day. I used to believe that one day one angelic girl would save me, but no, i now know that this simply isn't gonna happen, not now not in the future. 

I just feel awful, really. I fear about not being able to finish my degrees on time and not able to find a job, because I'd be sent back to my home country, a country that i don't identy with and that's a dictatorship. I fear about wasting my time and having to wait many years before i can get my citizenship and move to an eu country with better opportunities and salaries. I feel very unsafe and insecure, but i know that no one cares about me and i have no one to rely on.

My parents see me as a tool. Once i really couldn't hold anymore and told my bastard dad that i wanted to suicide. Guess what he said? If you did that imagine how bad it would be for my reputation, you fucking idiot!
Yeah they don't give a fuck about my emotions, my feelings, and this and that. 

I used to be quite good looking, but under the immense pressure during my high school (again they yelled at me and insulted me every single fucking day), i quickly turned bald ( i had only 18 yrs old at the time). And now i look much more like 30 yrs old than 21 yrs old.

I hate my parents and my bastard brother. I used to have very good memories about my childhood, but ever since they gave birth to another child, everything changed. They turned all their attention and resources into him, and i got nothing left. they would yell at me for the smallest thing I did, like eating a bit more, calling me faggot and useless, telling me to get the fuck out of their home asap.

Really, honestly, I've thought about not only killing myself but also killing them. Ofc the latter was just a thought, but really, the last five six yrs changed me tremendously. I used to be very optimistic, smile a lot, warm person. But no, i don't smile anymore, and I'm very selfish and cold. If i smile now, it's either fake or i do it involuntarily when watching some comedia or what. Ah guess what, whenever they hear me laugh, they will insult me, because they think it's not right for me to be happy while I'm eating their food and using their money to go to school.

Idk, really, i really hope i can get corona. I'm gonna do the third vaccination, and i hope it will fucking kill me, fucking end my life. I don't wanna live anymore. There has been enough suffering, enough hard life for me. I just wanna rest in piece, not to be awaken again, not to see my so-called bastard parents and brother again. Really, i hope i can die asap. I don't have the courage to end my life, I'm a fucking coward.

And i feel so unjust. Why am I so disadvantaged in terms of everything? I don't have citizenship in a country that I've been for 13 yrs. I don't have even a long-term residence. I'll have to wait for 10 yrs at least to get a citizenship in a country with terrible economy. I've not had any happy day since 12 yrs old, and i will never be able to be happy again. Why? Why is my life full of negative and bad things? Wtf is this life?

SuicideWatch,fmcppc,2020-03-21 15:27:34," 

I am obsessing over so much things even though the virus does not directly affect my lifestyle.

I have always been an isolator at home beside going to the mall every few weeks alone or going to the pub/club once-twice a year and getting close with someone or getting a bro hug from some dude.

It is destroying me mentally and psychically that people would no longer help in a time of crisis or give me a hug, it feels like all of these things are restricted. Even though i rarely get a hug or pat on the back from a stranger i meet when out, i am obsessing over something that has never impacted me.

I am creating scenarios in my head where i picture myself being stranded on a road or somewhere and i start to think ''Would a person still come to my aid and hug me? would a person still hug me tightly if i broke down and cried, would a person still rush to help me if i was on the floor dying'', despite these new restrictions. and i have just been obsessing over this.

It now feels that all contact is prohibited, even if it means helping someone you see who needs help. my mind has latched onto this ''social distancing'' concept and is driving me insane. I have also felt like my mental health does not matter, and that nothing matters because everyone cares about COVID now and nothing else.

Would people still hug or would people still do basic human things? many times during this pandemic i have started experiencing homicidal thoughts and suicidal thoughts, and how i would go about committing suicide. I haven't taken my valium in months but last night i had 4, and it's sorts of helped me soothe. It feels like i will be in this nightmare forever and society will never recover. I need help, warmth, and love, please don't leave me ):

SuicideWatch,vd1gww,2022-06-16 00:09:34,"Hey guys,

So lately been feeling like selling anything I own under my name, giving it to my family and ending this miserable life.

So this spiral I personally believe started with the first wave of Covid. Several of my businesses stopped work, I have a company that exports coal, iron ore and small amounts of gold. Several service businesses like a lounge, coffee shop and car wash. Exporting had completely halted for about 2 years, being able to export only small amounts compared to before, only managing to pay off wages of my employees. The lounge and coffee shop businesses almost shut down, but was able to keep them alive due to my own good credit score and getting favorable long-term loans. The only thing that kept going was the car wash venture. 

So I am from an asian household, I have 3 sisters, and the eldest son. As I was the man of the house to fill in my dad’s shoes, I was expecting a life of hardships and sleepless nights. When I was a kid, our family was dirt poor, some days I would leave the house drinking a cup of milk and licking some butter for the oil before school, it even became bad to a point where we became homeless and nowhere to go, and my father’s side relatives wouldn’t welcome us and my mom is a foreigner, as I experienced sleeping on the streets at age 13. During this time my older sister who was 19 at the time was studying abroad, my Dad provided everything for her. But he always drinks, and takes out his anger on me, I’d listen to him bullshitting through the nights, just so my mom could sleep, because she had experienced being admitted to the crazy twice already because she would read excessively, sometimes finishing several books within a day. So if she didn’t enough sleep she’d start reading like crazy again, my dad’s drunken screams never helped. 
We started renting a place to live, which didn’t last long, we ended up recieving help from on of his friends.

Then a few years later, his business started going well. I got 2 younger sisters, whom I had to babysit, in this way I lost my opportunity to develop my social skills early on, and I was known as the quiet and always sleepy kid in school. I just wanted to leave the country just to be away from them, so I got a $26k yearly scholarship to study in the states, but as an IT. My dad said he won’t pay a single cent for my plane tickets, and housing since IT is not a lucrative job. Said he’ll only support me if I change my major into bank finance after the 1st semester. So I gave up on my own dreams, and said fine if that’s what it takes for me to broaden my horizons. 

In any case, I am 27, single never married, and became a person with trust issues after being cheated on 2 relationship that lasted 3 and 1 year respectively. I don’t see myself marrying and having kids if I don’t 100% trust in my partner. I have 2 cars, 3 apartments, several businesses and a summer house in the countryside. Because of my inability to give my parents grandkids, I’ve been hammered and being called a letdown, which I’ve become very sensitive about whenever they bring it up.

Fast forward to today, I am been berated constantly for being unable to provide for them, unable to buy tickets for them to go abroad, unable to provide grandkids. And I honestly just want to sell everything I own, give it to them and drink myself to death on roof of an apartment complex project I started back in 2019 sept. which had to be halted due covid and then later unable due to finances.

I just want opinions and advices from similar men who are providing for their whole family, with asian traditions and values.
I don’t need sympathy, because I am with endless amount of things bottled up. Sometimes I wanna scream, I wanna cry, I wanna laugh hysterically, I wanna sing and dance, punch and kick. Instead of doing the above things, and hurting the pride of my family I just wanna end my life. But it’s like, I can’t bring myself to go to a funeral service hall and ask prices for my own self. Having fake tears from people, from people who only cared when I could provide. So maybe taking lethal dose of lsd, shrooms, or body function killers and going far away from the city, and hiring a guy for a couple thousand dollars to bury me secretly. 
Frankly my life ain’t that compared to many, but I am just tired, if at all possible I wanna drink and stay in bed until I feel like living again, but I can’t just ignore my 1172 employees like that. So killing myself seems logical and easier.

I need help, local psychiatrist looking at me judgementally saying non-challantly it’s gonna better, you live better than most and prescribing me pills. haha.

SuicideWatch,pnx2wo,2021-09-14 11:34:34,"Yeah, I know I just posted in here a few days ago. I planned on ending things at the end of this month because everything is getting ready to crash down around me shortly thereafter. Boy, was my time frame off.

I don't have much of a close friend network left at this point. Tonight, I got in a fight with most of what was left of it over issues with covid and the vaccine. I'm an outspoken supporter of vaccination and covid mitigation among them — but I've also very much supported vaccine choice and acknowledge them when they've raised legitimate concerns. But tonight, they let me have it when I stood my ground on the issue of vaccines and the legitimacy of science.

I've seen this coming for nearly two years now. I fooled myself into thinking it wasn't going to happen eventually, but I knew better. Over the past couple of years, it feels like everybody I know has become possessed — like it's not them anymore, but ideologues and propagandists speaking through them like puppets. It seems to apply to just about everyone, regardless of their particular beliefs or leanings. Who knows, maybe it applies to me too, and I just don't see it.

In the past 10 years, I've watched every relationship I've ever built crumble into nothing. I've watched relationships between my friends crumble. I've watched people turn against each other over the stupidest shit. Everywhere I look, it just seems like people are eating each other.

I'm really tired. 39 years and things have not gotten better, only worse. The world is going mad, and I don't know if I'm mad or sane anymore — or, rather, I don't think it actually matters. If you're counted among the crazy, does it really matter if you were actually sane or not? If you're innocent, but condemned as guilty, does it really matter if you were actually innocent? The truth of the matter becomes inconsequential and without substance. It's like a bunch of plankton arguing over which way they should go, when the current is just going to sweep them along the way it wants regardless.

The world is fucked, and I want off this train. Tomorrow, I have to take my dog to the vet for a minor surgery, and I will probably have to look after her closely for a few days after that. I'll take that time to write the note I've been wanting to write. After that, I'm done. I'm not doing anyone any good, I'm tired of living like this, and there is nothing to convince me that it will get better.

What lesson is there to be learned from being drugged and kidnapped from my childhood home and sold online to God knows how many sick fucking men? To be constantly homeless from the age of 6 to 22.

 My family tried so fucking hard but honestly I feel like a bad luck charm. I've never been a  junkie, I was a hard worker until I suddenly lost my job and home last year. But to be honest, catastrophes and severe trauma are common for my life, even though I keep trying to prevent them. 

Here I am unable to find employment, in turn no housing, immunocompromised (underdeveloped lungs) with a positive covid reading. I'm in so much pain, and I can't burden my family with more medical bills. If this is it, what a sick joke. God and life is a fucking joke. I hope all the priests jacking off in their churches feel real fucking good that most of us die sober on reality while they can diddle kids in their blissful religious delusions. Fuck off if you want to preach to me.

Ever since Covid I feel like my life has been stagnant and I have just regressed in every way possible. In 2020 I was accepted in an honours degree by my uni. Shortly after I had to drop out of it entirely because my family did not allow me to watch my lecture recordings since the internet we had was slow. When I tried watching my recordings, the internet would slow down for about 5 minutes for each lecture and my family went crazy on me forcing me to drop out because they figured what I was doing was less important and they couldn't stand the inconvenience. We were also in lockdown at the time so I couldn't really go anywhere else. After this, my family would bully me constantly asking me why I am not doing anything with my life.

In 2021 I started my Masters degree. Thankfully that year I had managed to beg enough of my family to convince them to install fibre internet so that we could all go on it without any issues. I was the only one who kept pleading for this because that was the only way they would have allowed me to use the internet and study. 2021 was such an awful year and my family would scream constantly while we were in and out of lockdowns. Because of the constant screaming, police calls and abuse hurled my way when I begged them for some peace (and being in lockdown with nowhere to go), I had to drop so many courses. Because of this I have reached the point now where I figure if I want to finish my masters degree, it will take me another 2 years with all the timetabling issues etc. I am so devastated and feel like the past 2 years have just been a constant struggle with my abusive family with nothing to show for myself other than additional trauma. I hate myself and my life so much.

With omicron on the horizon and my ocd, agoraphobia and fear of covid, idk what to do anymore. My family is more abusive than ever now and the arguments are too much. I cannot bear it anymore. I could barely study and sit my drivers license learners test recently because of the constant screaming and disregard for me. A lot of the arguments stem from my father's stay in a mental hospital in 2021 where he cheated on my mum with a nurse there. Now my mum cannot stop screaming abuse at him and taking out all of her anger on me and trying to force me to focus on my dad's cheating on her as the central focus of my life. I cannot do this anymore. My parents have abused me since I was little and have always loved to control me and never want to see me succeed or achieve any kind of independence. When my mum heard I was studying for my learners license that's when she amped up her arguing and screaming.",big rant guess want get things chest idk anything saying making sense sorry ever since covid feel like life stagnant regressed every way possible 2020 accepted honours degree uni shortly drop entirely family allow watch lecture recordings since internet slow tried watching recordings internet would slow 5 minutes lecture family went crazy forcing drop figured less important could stand inconvenience also lockdown time could really go anywhere else family would bully constantly asking anything life 2021 started masters degree thankfully year managed beg enough family convince install fibre internet could go without issues one kept pleading way would allowed use internet study 2021 awful year family would scream constantly lockdowns constant screaming police calls abuse hurled way begged peace lockdown nowhere go drop many courses reached point figure want finish masters degree take another 2 years timetabling issues etc devastated feel like past 2 years constant struggle abusive family nothing show additional trauma hate life much omicron horizon ocd agoraphobia fear covid idk anymore family abusive ever arguments much bear anymore could barely study sit drivers license learners test recently constant screaming disregard lot arguments stem father stay mental hospital 2021 cheated mum nurse mum stop screaming abuse taking anger trying force focus dad cheating central focus life anymore parents abused since little always loved control never want see succeed achieve kind independence mum heard studying learners license amped arguing screaming

SuicideWatch,qmtwu1,2021-11-05 02:04:10,"I have been suicidal for years and went through a traumatic breakup with an abusive partner early in the year, before vaccines were available to the public. Unfortunately, my ex is an EMT, and due to that I developed an extreme fear of ambulances which became a general phobia of being outside on my own. I don't have a car and can't afford rideshare, so my only option is public transport, which would cause humilitating public panic attacks.

At first, the only times I would leave was to go to my therapist, go out with my friends if they picked me up, or go on dates if they could pick me up (dating around was the only thing that gave me some relief from the breakup, unhealthy as it was). Eventually even that became too much and I attempted suicide twice during this time.

I knew I needed help to get vaccinated, but the only ones I felt remotely comfortable asking were my mom, and bizarrely my ex. My mom is antivax and thought it was a waste of time to help me. I became desperate enough to ask my ex last month, and he not only refused but encouraged me to just kill myself, which I did try to do.

I was in a coma and hospitalized for that month, and when I came back home, I was slowly trying to overcome my phobias. I even met someone through instagram that I met up with once and like a lot. Then my mom got covid and infected the whole family, me included.

All my progress has been halted. Being constantly dizzy and unable to taste or smell, maybe forever has drastically worsened my anxiety and depression, I lost my chance with someone I really liked, and what's worse is it's really my fault. I feel tremendously guilty and ashamed, and I can't stop thinking about just finally ending things.

SuicideWatch,og80rr,2021-07-08 19:42:41,"I live in Japan and I have been in the hospital with Covid for 2 days. I’m actually doing very well despite my asthma but my depression is another story. 

My mom died in 2018 and I found out she was sick the exact same day my cowardly ex boyfriend dumped my via text message. I was in the middle of giving things away in my apartment to move in with him so that’s how serious it was. My drug addicted and abusive dad died in 2020 when I was home in  quarantine and when that happened I finally cut off all contact with the rest of my abusive family. 

I don’t have a lot of friends here in Japan and whenever I do make friends they often leave. I also have a bad habit of getting into relationships with toxic people who are like my family so the relationships never end well or last long. I have only one true friend here in japan and she’s leaving at the end of this month and I’ll be truly alone after that. 

I called my ex out of loneliness and fear when I realized I was sick and he said I could call him again to talk. But then when I did he got angry because I called him during a Japanese class and he texted me  and said he wishes the best for me but to never contact him again. I was hurt and confused because if I had known he was going to be in a class I never would have called him back. I was only calling to tell him I was going into the hospital the next day and I told him that  via text and he never answered so I got angry and said he was a piece of shit. I guess he didn’t really want to talk to me again after the first call and was just looking for an excuse to tell me to leave him alone.

So I feel awful. I feel like no one loves me or cares about me. Not my family, not my ex, not my “friends” who really only want to be friends when it’s just about watching movies and doing superficial things. I feel all alone except for my one friend who lives here and my one friend in the states but she has her own life and can’t be here for me and my friend who lives here will be leaving soon. I just don’t see any reason to even get better. I’ve been on the earth 40 years and only two people will care that I’m gone. I just feel unlovable and unwanted and I feel like I’m just a scapegoat that everyone likes to blame for everything. Everyone told me my ex was a loser and not a good person and I just thought no there’s some good still in him and there isn’t and he clearly doesn’t even care if I die or not and he’s the last person I loved most in the world and I feel awful. 

I just don’t see the point in getting better just to be alone and sad all the time. My friend likes to bring up the fact that I’ve survived alot and I’ve done lots of traveling and have had many adventures but experiences and adventures don’t text me to see if I’m ok, they aren’t waiting for me at home to give me a hug and they don’t check on me when I’m in the hospital.

I really don't want to die but I don't want to suffer hopelessly anymore all alone. Plus I gained a hundred pounds over these yrs so no one will take me seriously. I had a boyfriend for yrs online that I thought understood my illness but I met him offline a few times and he was impatient with me and my slowness and criticized my eating because I binge eat unhealthy food to make the pain stop and he said maybe I wouldn't feel so bad if you didn't eat cupcakes everyday. He was correct and I know that but this all started before I was obese, sedentary, unhealthy diet, binge eating etc. 

The way I look on the outside doesn't match how I feel on the inside. I've never been blessed by looks but I at least wasn't always fat. Now I have this huge battle of losing 100 plus pounds and knowing it will help me and anyone's health immensely but angry at myself that I let it get this bad. I only had to do ONE THING, which was not be a landwhale and I couldn't do that and had to make myself even sicker.

SuicideWatch,k019zs,2020-11-24 14:04:22,"As someone who turned 25 last June, I haven't been the happiest person, in fact I've for the last 8 years I've been mulling over the idea of suicide. 

It started as a cynical joke, but the feeling of worthlessness and constant insecurities - and currently - the uncertainty about my fucking future has made the idea not only appealing but also seemingly my best hope. 

Given that I don't have a casual access to a gun, I just can't shoot myself in the head for a clean (relatively) guaranteed death. 

Taking pills that aren't cyanide is out of the question because they have a high survivability rate and are liable to fuck you up should you survive. Not to mention people will start treating differently if you do. 

I've mulled over the idea of just getting into a serious car accident, but that idea is similar to the pill-suicide but more extreme; sure death is more likely, but surviving is gonna leave you even more fucked up.

Now comes Covid. It's easy enough to get, if you do get it you're gonna know so no need for testing, and when you die the blame goes on Covid so you don't taint the ones associated with you the stigma of suicide. 

It's perfect! Absolutely perfect, you just need to die. 

Death from Covid is a 1-Way First Class ticket to absolution for all your failures in life.

Of course you gotta self isolate, don't be fucking selfish like one of those fucking anti-maskers and anti-vaccine. Just because people like myself have lost, nay abandoned, all hope doesn't mean other people have.

There are a couple things that worry me: of course my father's well-being, my cousins state of mind (the sons of this uncle) my aunt (she has health issues related to blood pressure) and my other cousin (the one that called) because he got the last message my uncle sent (around 3am)  before trying to die, so my cousin feels a lot of guilt for not being able to listen at the right moment.

SuicideWatch,mlx8p7,2021-04-07 13:32:21," **Abstract**  
I feel like my life has been a waste. I lived a privileged life and have tried to give back to my communities, but day after day I feel like it's all a sham. In some ways, my pessimistic attitudes have been amplified because of life under the pandemic. I've also been acutely away of systematic injustices pre-COVID and continue to remain hypercritical about what the ""return to normality"" entails. After all of my scholarly pursuits and employment in the education sector, I feel drained and can't help thinking if there's a way to stop this unfulfillment.

**Introduction/Bio**  
I've had suicidal ideation since I was \~15. I stuck it through year by year, entered college with a generous scholarship, finished undergrad in five years (no debt), ran several non-profits and now support myself with a full-job gig at an R1 university. Despite all of this, I still feel empty and unaccomplished. Once this summer rolls around, all my friends & favorite coworkers will have moved away and I will have no support system for under-staffed, in-person operations. I don't know why I'm still sticking around. I have some money in my savings, but not enough to move out to a new city. I spent 2020 donating surplus income away to mutual aid relief projects so I had some reason of waking up everyday. Aside from that, the only other reason why I'm still alive is so that my retired parents don't have to suffer with the premature death of their only child. Once they're no longer here, I've sketched out a plan to do away with all my belongings (and inheritance - if I get any) by placing it into a trust fund designated for my friends so they can pay of their debts and help non-profits.

**Counseling & Self-Treatment**  
I've been to counseling here and there over the years, but I've been burnt out by the 'mental health' industry. I've developed abandonment issues from therapists who have stopped attending me (e.g. leaving the clinic to work elsewhere, cancel meetings, refusal to hear me out/collaborate). The wait times between sessions have grown to 3 months - assuming the clerical staff remember to book my appointments (which, they have forgotten on several instances). I've gotten to the point of giving up on relying on my health insurance and resorting to self-help treatment, but it's been a struggle. I can grasp why so many people engage in recreational drugs to get through life and I have often fancied seeing how deep that rabbit hole goes down...  
I have stayed sober and busy by using my free time to volunteer through a number of non-profits. Over the last \~six years, I've ran several organizations and tried to develop some comradery, but all of my colleagues have moved on with their lives. This has effectively put me in an awkward position as I remain to be the sole individual with institutional knowledge of how to make movements happen year after year. I've committed myself to writing how-to guides & publishing websites so that I no longer have to be burdened with the notion of ending the community culture if I were to suddenly disappear...

**Friends & Relationships**  
My best friends from my school days have moved on with their significant others. My longest relationship was \~9 months long and it concluded with me withdrawing from grad school and couch surfing into the early days of the pandemic. In some ways, I still haven't healed from that yet and feel scarred of entering another romantic entanglement or returning to grad school.

**Conclusion**  
All in all, I'd like to think of myself as a capable human with something to offer to the world - but I just don't see the point of trying anymore when so many broken systems and no resolution in sight (e.g. Academia/education, health care, political system, global climate crisis... everything just seems to suck). As good as it may be to get fully vaccinated, I have nobody to spend time with through this madness. I just see an infinite load of thankless work that remains to be done and no light at the end of the tunnel. At some level, it just makes sense to skip all the futile work & heartache and just end it all...",abstract feel like life waste lived privileged life tried give back communities day day feel like sham ways pessimistic attitudes amplified life pandemic also acutely away systematic injustices continue remain hypercritical return normality entails scholarly pursuits employment education sector feel drained ca help thinking way stop unfulfillment suicidal ideation since stuck year year entered college generous scholarship finished undergrad five years debt ran several support gig r1 university despite still feel empty unaccomplished summer rolls around friends favorite coworkers moved away support system operations know still sticking around money savings enough move new city spent 2020 donating surplus income away mutual aid relief projects reason waking everyday aside reason still alive retired parents suffer premature death child longer sketched plan away belongings inheritance get placing trust fund designated friends pay debts help counseling counseling years burnt health industry developed abandonment issues therapists stopped attending leaving clinic work elsewhere cancel meetings refusal hear wait times sessions grown 3 months assuming clerical staff remember book appointments forgotten several instances gotten point giving relying health insurance resorting treatment struggle grasp many people engage recreational drugs get life often fancied seeing deep rabbit hole goes stayed sober busy using free time volunteer number last years ran several organizations tried develop comradery colleagues moved lives effectively put awkward position remain sole individual institutional knowledge make movements happen year year committed writing guides publishing websites longer burdened notion ending community culture suddenly disappear friends relationships best friends school days moved significant others longest relationship months long concluded withdrawing grad school couch surfing early days pandemic ways still healed yet feel scarred entering another romantic entanglement returning grad school conclusion like think capable human something offer world see point trying anymore many broken systems resolution sight health care political system global climate crisis everything seems suck good may get fully vaccinated nobody spend time madness see infinite load thankless work remains done light end tunnel level makes sense skip futile work heartache end

SuicideWatch,laqq8c,2021-02-02 13:33:03,"I tell you my story as a cautionary tale for anyone who struggles with depression and gets COVID. The shit is serious and may tip you over the edge, so be careful and seek professional help immediately if you notice warning signs like insomnia, heavy mood swings or obsessive thoughts.

I survived a suicide attempt 3 weeks ago and now I’m processing what happened and what led me there (I never had recurring suicidal thoughts in my life and don’t have them now, so it’s hard for me to accept what I’ve done).

A short factual description of what happened: I’m in early 30s, in December I was still living with my gf, we both got COVID, it seemed to hit my brain somewhat harder than in average case (I had occasional dizziness and 100% loss of smell/taste 4 weeks after first symptoms). In early January we split with my gf, I moved to my flat and started reflecting on my life and our relationships. It took a toll on me, I slept 3-4 hours for 8 days in a row. The week was an emotional rollercoaster for me, I felt mania-like symptoms with some extreme mood swings (in the same hour I could feel completely opposite emotions towards my ex and myself). I started seeking psychiatrist help to get some meds for sleep, but unfortunately due to post-New Year slowness my appointment was set for too late. I jumped out of the 5th floor window literally 14 hours before it. 

The way I arrived to this point was more impulsive than planned. On 8th day of my nervous breakdown and sleep deprivation, I started seeing “signs from god/universe” that I’m in the simulation designed to test my resolve and honesty. They told me that I need to gather my courage and end this life in order to wake up in the real one (yeap, exactly like The Matrix plot). I also had a few Biblical references spinning in my head (I felt a lot of guilt towards people I hurt / betrayed, so Judas story seemed relevant, and as you might know he killed himself in repent after betraying Jesus). 

All this shit spinning in my head led me to stepping over the edge. I turned out to be extremely lucky since 1) I’m alive 2) I haven’t broken my back or my head, only a dozen of ribs and my hip bones, so in a few months I’ll be able to walk.",tell story cautionary tale anyone struggles depression gets covid shit serious may tip edge careful seek professional help immediately notice warning signs like insomnia heavy mood swings obsessive thoughts survived suicide attempt 3 weeks ago processing happened led never recurring suicidal thoughts life hard accept done short factual description happened early 30s december still living gf got covid seemed hit brain somewhat harder average case occasional dizziness 100 loss 4 weeks first symptoms early january split gf moved flat started reflecting life relationships took toll slept hours 8 days row week emotional rollercoaster felt symptoms extreme mood swings hour could feel completely opposite emotions towards ex started seeking psychiatrist help get meds sleep unfortunately due year slowness appointment set late jumped 5th floor window literally 14 hours way arrived point impulsive planned 8th day nervous breakdown sleep deprivation started seeing signs simulation designed test resolve honesty told need gather courage end life order wake real one yeap exactly like matrix plot also biblical references spinning head felt lot guilt towards people hurt betrayed judas story seemed relevant might know killed repent betraying jesus shit spinning head led stepping edge turned extremely lucky since 1 alive 2 broken back head dozen ribs hip bones months able walk

I have my dream job. I make 6 figures. I have the car I always wanted. My first house is being built. I have an amazing boyfriend. All of this after 6 years of hard work. But I just can't be happy.

Where I live covid has become so political that it literally drained all the life out of me. We have been on lockdown for the second time since oct 2020. We have a 9h30 curfew since jan 2021. I work evenings so I can't even go take a walk to blow off steam after woek because of the stupid curfew.

People who have been vaccinated were sent qr codes as proof. We need to show this when we leave the house or when restaurants/bars eventually open up. I feel like I'm being tracked.

I had a friend over who was getting abused by her boyfriend. I get that it's illegal where I live, but we were trying to figure out living arrangements for her. The neighbours called thr cops on me. We each got fined $1526 even though we tried to explain the situation. The police didn't even stay to make sure my friend left.

SuicideWatch,gva3ds,2020-06-02 21:38:14,"Badly summarized TLDR at bottom. Let me first be clear: my dog has tons of chew toys, sufficient food, water, and I work from home so he gets plenty attention and exercise. He has had separation anxiety issues since I got him 2 years ago, but those have been improving greatly with training and positive reinforcement over the past year. But since the pandemic hit my state and I had to get a work at home job, he is no longer accustomed to me leaving the house and his separation anxiety has, evidently, come back along with the destructive chewing that was a problem in his puppy days. We were working on that again and so far, until today, have had no incidents other than a pillow back around when the stay at home order first started, and occasionally sticking his nose in areas he shouldn't. In the mornings, consistently for the past few months, I have been able to get up and do my morning routine while he sleeps in the bed since he is a heavy sleeper, then i let him out to potty. This includes making myself breakfast. So this morning, over the course of maybe 20 minutes, i got up, left him sound asleep as usual, took a shower, made a small breakfast, and was in the middle of eating it when I heard a crack come from the bedroom. 

He got my Nintendo Switch Lite. 

I went into the room and saw it in his grubby paws with his mouth still on the corner.

My mental state has been slowly declining. Coming to terms with just how damaged my self worth is from an abusive school career, seeing news about the riots and police brutality across the country, knowing that we are probably on the brink of a war between citizens and a corrupt government, COVID, dealing with difficult/unrecognized issues and feeling inadequate at my new tech support job, needing to get tested for COVID because I am showing symptoms, worrying if I have it because I get bad bronchitis easily from just a cold, not having health insurance so I can neither get treatment if its needed or go back on mental health meds, and so much more.

 Eating a weed gummy, hopping on Animal Crossing, and playing with my friends felt like my only escape from the madness. And now it's gone. My ONLY solace is that it may be able to get repaired within my price range because it still powers on and runs games fine, but a lot of the buttons needed to effectively play have been destroyed, ripped out, or jammed and the casing is broken.

 If anyone here has read this far, doesn't play Animal Crossing for the switch and is wondering why I am so upset: Nintendo made the absolutely most idiotic decision I have ever seen for a game that requires hundreds of hours of creative work and all of the save data for the game is confined to one console's storage with no backups or data transfers. If I need to replace my switch lite, my town that I have been logging into every day for WEEKS and tirelessly pumping out any creativity I have left is effectively lost until nintendo releases their ONE TIME rescue transfer option later this year and I can afford a new console. And even if I can get the repair done and keep my data, it wont be done for weeks and i run the risk of losing villagers right after I have pretty much gotten all my favorites. 

I have been through so much and survived, but losing what is essentially the biggest creative project I've done in the midst of of everything else going on may just be enough to break me. It makes me kind of hope that, should my test for COVID come back positive, I'm one of the ones that it takes. At least then no one can get mad at me for suicide. If not though, there's a river nearby that is pretty notable for drownings i guess.

TLDR: my dog is an untrainable asshole and destroyed my nintendo switch, which held my only mental escape (animal crossing) and i may lose 500+ hours of creative work.

At the time it felt fucking awesome because yay video games but now I’m really regretting it. ever since august of 2020 I started feeling self conscious about my height and really started to put an effort into sleeping earlier hoping that it would make up for the lost hours cuz I searched up if sleep deprivation decreases adult height and well, it does...

Lost both of my jobs due to COVID found my dad lying on the floor lifeless from a disease he had suffered through for years having to decide whether he peacefully pass or resuscitate to let him suffer more. Yet decide to resuscitate him and let him suffer because I would not be able to handle the backlash and disownment of my family for letting him go. I gave up my education for my masters degree to take care of my father to only have a meaningless Bachelors degree. I had to decide whether my unborn daughter to live and my girlfriend to die because she has multiple autoimmune conditions to where she would not live after the birth of our daughter. Not only do the hardships of caring for my girlfriend she has had severe PTSD episodes to where I am holding her off from killing herself or harming me. To then having to send her to the hospital after holding her off resulting in concussions and multiple rib fractures each time leaving me to sob thinking I beat her. Not only did I love her unconditionally and wanted to build our relationship to marriage she decides to break her promises to leave because she can’t handle our relationship. I no longer have friends or meaningful relationships because my father was my best friend and my other friends have their own lives too busy to be spending time with me nor care to invite me even when they do. My father now is in hospice waiting for his time to pass while I’m home alone with nothing but my trauma and heartache to sulk in with no hobbies to engage in due to COVID-19.

SuicideWatch,lvjv6k,2021-03-02 02:08:15,"This year is lining up to worse than the last year and Im not sure I can take it. I dropped out of uni (I hated my course) a few years and got a job. I had fun, earned some money lost my virginity, it was great. I went back to uni, this time to do what I loved (I won't say to not identify myself). Also great. Then covid happened. I was doing a very practical course so the last few months of the first year were wasted. I decided not to go back because I didn't want to waste money sitting in my room all day. I made it back home. Can't see friends or get involved with my only hobby for covid reasons. Can't see live music etc etc. The only thing I could do that kept me sane was play video games. My grandad was not well (cancer). He died. I got a new shittier job and then later get another shit job with slightly more pay. My grandma died from covid shortly after. I saw her twice last year and once was through a window. A friend died also died from cancer in January.

Part 2
Me and my dad and sister were looking for a new house for 3 years (my mum died when I was younger). We didn't want to stay in the house where she died anymore and it was piling up to too much work in the end especially when my sister moved out. We found a house about a year ago. We made it super clear that we wanted it. They have to find a house to and we have to sell ours. We get a good offer and sell our house. I move in with my sister and my dad rents a place. my sister's house is tiny so I can't bring video games or my other main hobby with me. I have nothing but it's okay right because we will be moving soon right? We were still waiting on the owners of the house to find a new place when we moved out which is risky I know. They find a place a couple weeks later! Great. A couple more weeks pass. Their offer on the house they wanted gets rejected. Not really their fault and j don't mind waiting. There's a housing bubble here and property prices are getting extreme. Then it happens. They Jordan Belfort us by deciding they don't want to move. I am now technically homeless with no end in sight. Property prices are so high compared to a year ago, nothing in our budget suits our needs. They wasted a year of my life and our life. I know it took a heavy toll on my dad too. However my sister and my dad have something though. They can still partake in their hobbies and interests while I have nothing. I started watching anime again after years, I tried reading and watching movies but the repetitive insanity is setting in and it's making these things unenjoyable because I can't concentrate on these things for so long, hour after hour, day after day.

Part 3
Here's the cherry on top. A new guy comes into work and they start training him for the job that I've been gunning for since I started despite having less experience than me! It might sound kind of incelish but he's very extroverted, social, very tall and older. I feel like he's jumped ahead of me for his character and appearance while I've been sidelined despite being better for the job.

The money in the bank is getting less and less each day. The one time I went to a doctor was in April and they tried to tell me it was anxiety. This is not anxiety. Sure, I also have anxiety because of the uncertainties and the duration of the suffering, but that is not the explanation of the sickness. It is a chronic lingering inflammation.

I cannot even think too hard without a risk of flaring up. Every moment I have to pace myself.

My sister has been diagnosed with depression in the past and she's on antidepressants. She just had a baby a couple months ago and a few days ago she entered a really intense state of what seems to be psychosis... She's having the ""I believe in God now and I'm gonna save the world"" delusions and all that... I have my ideas for what's going on don't want to speculate too much, especially not here, because I think it's against the rules...

What I do need advice on is how we can get her admitted. Her husband took her to urgent care and she actually ended up having to be sedated. She had COVID weeks ago and her symptoms have come and gone, but she's still testing positive. No one will take her because a lot of the evaluation is in a group setting, but she REALLY needs this psych evaluation. She's in the hospital now which is good because she is safer there, but she has a baby at home who misses *both* of his parents and I'm just starting to feel so hopeless. This COVID roadblock is making me feel like she might not actually get the help she needs any time soon and because of her behavior, I just can't believe that there doesn't seem to be any alternative... They're just allowing her to remain in this clearly concerning mental state.

bipolar,zydgvd,2022-12-30 00:39:10,"Hi all,

Wanted to hear about your related experience / whether this is normal.

I had covid \~3 weeks ago. I'm male/in my 30s so was not expecting it to be very intense or disruptive. I got sicker than I thought I would and it lasted about 5 days. However, my sleep and anxiety got thrown way out of whack by it. I have never had a full on manic episode in my life but after a couple of nights of not sleeping **at all** (very very unlike me) I had a funny feeling that I was on the verge of going in that direction. My doctor gave me gabapentin to sleep and reduced my welbutrin, hoping to decrease any stimulating effects. A little over a week later and I'm starting to sleep decently again but now I'm feeling pretty seriously depressed, like periods of desperation at a level of intensity that I haven't experienced in 5-6 years.

A little bit of backstory, I began seeking psychiatric care around 9 years ago for severe depression. At some point a doctor diagnosed me as bipolar ii, to which everyone in my family was like ""...you're not bipolar..."" I ignored them and embraced the diagnosis at the time and got on bipolar meds. They sort of stabilized me but never really took away the depression and also left me with a lot of very disruptive side effects. Over time I started feeling skeptical about the diagnosis. For example my therapist who I've been working with for 9 years doesn't think I remind her of her other bipolar patients and most conceptions of mania/hypomania don't map clearly to my past self. I wanted to see if I could be on less medication and I successfully went from 300mg/day of seroquel to no seroquel over the course of 2/3 years, seemingly without my mood being destabilized.

Around 3 months ago I asked my p doc to decrease my lithium. She suggested going from 1350mg/day to 900mg/day (side note: I've started wondering if that's an abnormally large jump for a psych med decrease, what do you think?). I trusted her suggestion and carried out the decrease. I felt a little panicky at moments during the first month or so but this feeling went away. Sleep was a little bit lighter but not so much that I thought it was a real problem. Even while at my highest levels of being medicated I would still have regular down turns in my mood which were intense. So I naturally had a few such down turns (which was expected) and they came and went, only thing worth noting is that without the numbing effect of lithium they were more painful.

But all in all I seemed to be handling the decrease fairly well, even with a number of very stressful elements in my life situation (losing my job/being unemployed, ongoing addiction recovery, a recent near death experience, being broke and needing to live with parents while getting back on my feet, facing the rejection of the job hunt, the general state of the world (note, these were all in play before the decrease except for the job search)). I wasn't convinced that it was working out but I thought there was a chance that I would pull through to a new stability at the reduced dose.

That all changed when I got covid. Now I'm feeling kinda scared. I had never experienced that kind of insomnia before and was kind of freaked out by that feeling that I could potentially be going manic or slipping back to my old, very serious levels of depression. I really don't want to be on lithium because I feel like an utter shell of the person that I used to be while on it, because it makes me feel mentally impaired, kills my motivation and joy, and because it's a piece of shit fucking drug that ruined my thyroid and and might fuck up my kidneys someday. Need I say more? I've been through the gamut of psych meds and what I've found is that they just don't work very well. They can decrease the odds of killing yourself or running through the streets naked but they don't really make you into a happy successful person, and might block you off from parts of yourself that would help you become that. Ugh.

So basically my question is..

**Question: Did anyone else have a serious psychiatric flare up following a covid infection? Did it resolve itself on its own as time passed or did it require a new level of intervention?**

Bonus question: Have you ever attempted a medication decrease that failed but then you tried again at a later time when your life had settled more and then had long term success with it (defining long term success as > 1 year of mood stability).

**tl;dr** \- I tried decreasing my lithium 3 months ago (with medical support/supervision). It was going alright but then I got covid and now I feel kind of fucked up.

bipolar,ydqtyx,2022-10-26 11:53:23,"Just want to know if anyone had a similar experience. I was diagnosed with bipolar pretty soon after I got COVID back in January 2022.

For background, I had never had COVID until that point. I had struggled with mental illness for over a decade though (I’m 27 now, and first started seeing a psychiatrist about age 14). I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Tried lots of medicines mostly SSRI. They all seemed to just make things worse. Eventually I gave up. I stopped getting treatment and went a few years not on any medicine and I was mostly fine, besides like occasional panic attacks and just generally not feeling great.

In January I got COVID and something changed drastically. I got extremely sick and I was basically confined to a bed for three weeks. I just wanted to get up and move on but when it came time to, I couldn’t. I feel like there is something keeping half my brain from working. I was always so sharp before. I actually had just graduated with a masters degree and suddenly I couldn’t remember people’s names. I also felt really aggressive. I stopped eating and sleeping and got in a huge fight with my boss at work and my doctor told me it was a manic episode and put me on a mood stabilizer. It did help.

bipolar,16lr47w,2023-09-18 15:20:10,"  


Despite being bipolar and having extreme difficulties leading a normal life (hospitalized twice in 2013) I managed to go against the odds:  


 I graduated from a good university in Moscow, Russia; the following year (2018) I got an internship at a local reputable VC firm and in 2019 got promoted to an investment analyst. My career was an extreme success, I was getting consistently promoted and was one of the youngest people in the local VC environment. Despite the fact that I had a hard time being efficient and disciplined (I have to sleep 10-11 hours due to Seroquel and sleep problems and I have pretty strong ADHD symptoms) I pushed my way through working night hours, dedicating my whole life to my job.  


In 2020 I relocated to Europe, to the country where I did not know anyone and had only 1 colleague.   
Hardly had I relocated, COVID kicked in. I spent weeks in complete isolation, working on a bunch of very tedious and soul-burning projects. By the end of April 2020, I got to the worst state of mental health since 2013 - 2014: I felt alienated, threatened by everything around me, ravaged, and exhausted,. Whenever I tried to go to sleep (I went up to 300-400 mg of Seroquel) I felt (not necessarily hallucinating) that something was approaching me, I constantly felt things were hostile towards me, experienced strong cramps and seizures, and could not sleep.   


My performance changed. I went from a guy who could not get separated from his laptop to a guy who could not see one. I got back home to Moscow (which did not help much) in 2021, went from 95 kg to 145 kg and finally got fired mid 2021. I was picked up as a corporate strategy guy by another company and could not wake up normally and make it to the calls so I got fired again in several months.  


I decided to take a breath for 2 -3 months and in 2022 January started the search. My CV still was very strong and there was a strong interest in my persona. I had 20 processes, got rejected only by ±2 - 3 companies, ±5 told me I was overqualified and I was choosing from the remaining ones. Then the war (Ukraine war) started and all the positions were shut down and I had nowhere to go.  


I tried to search for some alternative jobs (not super relevant, SDR / bizdev stuff in tech companies abroad), not sure that was the right choice but yeah - nothing, literally nothing. Only 1 proper interview process with an NY-based startup that I failed at the last stage.

In April 2022 I stopped the search and literally went to do nothing: play Dota 2 24/7 up until October 2022. Then I had to relocate due to mobilization and once relocated spent some time again on a job search ( nothing, not a single proper interview process), and after that started exploring doing SMTH on my own. I tried several stuff and nothing really worked out for me. 

Now I am doing stuff I do not like, I landed a BD job at a software house and this is very boring compared to what I used to do, and feels like I am really more than I do now. I tried a couple of interviews on the PE/VC front but 1 thing popped up now: it has been 2 years guys, I forgot stuff, not in that shape anymore  


**My idea is that I should forget about everything I did in the past and try to go a different route. Reset my career completely. I am choosing now where to go: Data Science, front-end development or game development.** 

I feel jaded sometimes as if I am in a nightmare: from utter success to constant misery with no way out. I literally start my day and whenever I remember what I used to be, that almost makes me faint, my ankles get filled with lead and my breath goes away. I want to quit my job now. For the past 2 -3 weeks I have felt sick (that actually happens every 2 months, I am a sickly person I suppose due to stress) with dry mouth, flu, sore throat, dizziness, everything and it does not really go away and intensifies when I think about what happened to my career... It gets worse when I look around: my family struggles financially and I used to be the only one who could be helpful (out of 4 kids)

**Another Hidden Covid Risk: Lingering Kidney Problems**


In a study of veterans, Covid survivors were 35 percent more likely than other patients to have long-term kidney damage or declines in kidney function.


Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors have found that people who become very ill with Covid-19 often experience kidney problems, not just the lung impairments that are the hallmark of the illness.


Now, a large study suggests that kidney issues can last for months after patients recover from the initial infection, and may lead to a serious lifelong reduction of kidney function in some patients.


The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, found that the sicker Covid patients were initially, the more likely they were to experience lingering kidney damage.


But even people with less severe initial infections could be vulnerable.


“You see really, across the board, a higher risk of a bunch of important kidney-associated events,” said Dr. F. Perry Wilson, a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Yale, who was not involved in the study. “And what was particularly striking to me was that these persisted.”


Kidneys play a vital role in the body, clearing toxins and excess fluid from the blood, helping maintain a healthy blood pressure, and keeping a balance of electrolytes and other important substances. When the kidneys are not working properly or efficiently, fluids build up, leading to swelling, high blood pressure, weakened bones and other problems.


The heart, lungs, central nervous system and immune system can become impaired. In end-stage kidney disease, dialysis or an organ transplant may become necessary. The condition can be fatal.


The new study, based on records of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, analyzed data from 89,216 people who tested positive for the coronavirus between March 1, 2020, and March 15, 2021, as well as data from 1,637,467 people who were not Covid patients.


**Between one and six months after becoming infected, Covid survivors were about 35 percent more likely than non-Covid patients to have kidney damage or substantial declines in kidney function,** said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the V.A. St. Louis Health Care System and senior author of the study.


“People who have survived the first 30 days of Covid are at risk of developing kidney disease,”  said Dr. Al-Aly, a nephrologist and assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine.


Because many people with reduced kidney function do not experience pain or other symptoms, “what’s really important is that people realize that the risk is there and that physicians caring for post-Covid patients really pay attention to kidney function and disease,” he said.


The two sets of patients in the study differed, in that members of one group had all been infected with Covid and members of the other group may have had a variety of other health conditions. Experts cautioned that there were limitations to the comparisons.


The researchers tried to minimize the differences with detailed analyses that adjusted for a long list of demographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, medication usage and whether people were in nursing homes.


Another limitation is that patients in the V.A. study were largely male and white, with a median age of 68, so it is unclear how generalizable the results are.


One strength of the research, experts said, is that it involves over 1.7 million patients with detailed electronic medical records, making it the largest study so far on Covid-related kidney problems.


While the results most likely would not apply to all Covid patients, they show that for those in the study, “there’s a pretty notable impact on kidney health in survivors of Covid-19 over the long term, particularly those who were very sick during their acute illness,” said Dr. C. John Sperati, a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins, who was not involved in the study.


Other researchers have found similar patterns, “so this is not the only study suggesting that these events are transpiring after Covid-19 infection,” he added.


He and other experts said that if even a small percentage of the millions of Covid survivors in the United States developed lasting kidney problems, the impact on health care would be great.


To assess kidney function, the research team evaluated levels of creatinine, a waste product that kidneys are supposed to clear from the body, as well as a measure of how well the kidneys filter the blood called the estimated glomerular filtration rate.


Healthy adults gradually lose kidney function over time, about 1 percent or less a year, starting in their 30s or 40s, Dr. Wilson said. Serious illnesses and infections can cause more profound or permanent loss of function that may lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease.


**The new study found that 4,757 Covid survivors had lost at least 30 percent of kidney function in the year after their infection, Dr. Al-Aly said.**


That is equivalent to roughly “30 years of kidney function decline,” Dr. Wilson said.


Covid patients were 25 percent more likely to reach that level of decline than people who had not had the illness, the study found.


Smaller numbers of Covid survivors had steeper declines. But Covid patients were 44 percent more likely than non-Covid patients to lose at least 40 percent of kidney function and 62 percent more likely to lose at least 50 percent.


End-stage kidney disease, which occurs when at least 85 percent of kidney function is lost, was detected in 220 Covid patients, Dr. Al-Aly said. Covid survivors were nearly three times as likely to receive the diagnosis as patients without Covid, the study found.


Dr. Al-Aly and his colleagues also looked at a type of sudden renal failure called acute kidney injury, which other studies have found in up to half of hospitalized Covid patients. The condition can heal without causing long-term loss of kidney function.

bipolar,ru19lk,2022-01-02 09:44:43,"**TL;DR: TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR PHARMACIST IF YOU NEED TO START TAKING THIS TO SEE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO STAY SAFE AND COMPLIANT WITH YOUR MEDICATION. ANTIPSYCHOTICS ARE AFFECTED BY ONE OF THE DRUGS THAT MAKE UP PAXLOVID. A SAFE SOLUTION CAN BE WORKED OUT TO ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR MEDS AND TAKE THIS DRUG, IF NECESSARY. GET YOUR SHOTS! GET YOUR BOOSTERS!**

Here's what I know: Paxlovid is made up of two drugs: nirmatrelvir, and ritonavir. For a little bit of a deeper look into these drugs, [check out this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/rmzsay/paxlovid/)

I did some checking on [drugs.com](https://drugs.com/), to see whether my medications would be impacted. Surprise surprise, vraylar (cariprazine) is. Ritonavir is a CYP3A inhibitor, which is an enzyme that is crucial for vraylar, and many other antipsychotics, to be metabolized. This means if I were to start taking paxlovid tomorrow, it would dangerously increase the levels of vraylar in my system.

So what do you do?

I talked to a friend of mine that is a board-certified pharmacist, who has been working with covid patients since this all started, and he pointed out to me that these are the kinds of questions pharmacists are trained to solve. **And this is a solved problem.**

With my drug specifically, he sent me clinical guidelines pharmacists can use when adjusting for a CYP3A inhibitor.

He also suggested a staggered dosing schedule that I could adhere to for my maintenance medication while I'm stuck taking paxlovid, if necessary.

Bottom line. A solution can be worked out. This is not the end of the world. Don't catastrophize. AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY TALK TO YOUR FUCKING DOCTORS. Bring up this interaction if you are impacted BEFORE you get covid and BEFORE you need to take this medication, so you have a game plan. Figure something out NOW. You very well may need it later.

bipolar,glos8d,2020-05-18 03:52:39,"Since lockdown my partner believes I may have bipolar. I think they may be right. My experience basically meets all the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar 1, with a possible exception that I will outline below.

Some of the problematic behavior I have engaged in:

* starting lots of business ideas and never finishing anything
* having lots of ideas and never doing anything with them (I have always done this)
* buying lots of domain names
* Not sleeping enough and sleeping at weird hours
* Feeling like I am going through a spiritual awakening
* Changing my identity on online platforms, making new Twitter accounts
* Signing up for a lot of new services
* Buying a lot of stuff out of interest online

It's been like this for over two months. It has been a problem in my relationship for sure and if I had a normal 9-5 job then I'm pretty sure I would have been fired. I am not struggling financially but I feel like it could eventually become a problem.

But while I am very agitated and impatient all the time I really like the mental clarity and ideas that I'm coming up with. I just would love to be able to actually execute on any of them. 

My partner suggested that I go to a psychiatrist. I also think this is probably a good idea but I'm struggling to even do this because I'm struggling to finish anything. And I keep worrying about whether taking anti-psychotics will cause me to lose more of my already fragile memory and/or permanently take me out of this state, which for the most part I enjoy and it would be sad to permanently lose access to it.

Curious if anyone else is experiencing something like this and what my next steps should be?

However, my symptoms were almost all gone after I tested positive for COVID . I actually felt normal again (which I hadn't in years).

Every few months, my husband decides he hates me. It either starts with a fight, is triggered by something that upsets him, or seems to have no trigger at all. He will give me the silent treatment, tell me all our problems are my fault, and withdraw from me emotionally.

This last time is the worst. He told me that he's suicidal because of me. While I know this can't be true (because he was suicidal before he ever met me) its killing me inside anyway. He's not speaking to me. He won't do anything to help me at all.

I depend on my husband to get my wheelchair in and out of the car and to help me in and out of the house. 

I told him this in a quiet voice because I'm scared to ask him for anything. He first suggested I ask my elderly father to do it. Which I won't do because a) I don't want him leaving his house b) I won't risk his health by taking him to a testing center and c) my dad is frail and cannot lift my wheelchair.

I feel broken. I feel hated. I feel completely unloved. And I don't know what to do. I would never leave him in the lurch like this. How can I get through to him? I feel like right now, in his depressive state, he truly doesn't care if I live or die.

bipolar,k7nwi9,2020-12-06 11:08:01,"Hi, I guess I just need to vent because I'm scared and alone. I'm scared for the wrong reasons and I'm alone because I have decided no one loves me so I obviously can't call anyone. It all started when my sister called to tell me her husband tested positive for covid and I had been to their house the previous weekend. I recently moved out of their house into my own place and was picking up the things I forgot. I can't leave anywhere without forgetting something. I got tested on Friday, late afternoon and I don't expect the results until Monday at the very earliest and enter the anxiety. 

I honestly am not that worried about getting sick but I am immunocompromised and I have had some serious illnesses and lots of extended hospital stays. I have a genetic blood disease and a long sob story so I'll move past it. I don't think I'm scared or anxious about being sick. I guess I don't know what I'm feeling really. I worry about my boyfriend getting sick even though he is extremely healthy and I worry about having to isolate by myself for so long. I was already feeling isolated after the new place smell and excitement about answering to no one wore off. 

I'm frustrated my sister waited until he tested positive to tell me because I could have taken a test sooner. I'm frustrated at my boyfriend for telling me there is nothing to be anxious about ultimately shutting down any further discussion about it. I don't want to seem crazy...ier. I can't talk to my Mom because she isn't sleeping as it it. She worries about me constantly. Constantly. I don't know how she finds the time to do anything else. I called my doctor but only talked to a nurse. She was comforting for the few minutes I talked to her. 

The thing is I'm pretty medicated and so I do feel the anxiety in my head as much. I know it's their because I can't sleep but it's not like I can't sleep because I'm thinking about that. I can't sleep because I keep thinking about this painting I want to do. I can see them so perfectly in my head but I have no talent. I can't get anything out because I can't stand to look at anything I create. It's all trash just like me. The biggest worry I have, the real one is all the times I wished for death in a way that couldn't be considered my fault you know, so know one can be mad at me about it. What if I get my wish and do I even still want it? One time I wished for an illness to kill me because I was sad and I got meningococcal meningitis and a whole new set of problems. I know it's crazy to believe I can make things happen with the power of my ruminating thoughts but sometimes I think maybe it's not that crazy. My sleep is all over the place. I slept for 14 hours one night to no hours to 3 hours. I don't feel tired now. I don't feel able to complete even the simplest of tasks tho either.

bipolar,fky7k9,2020-03-19 03:36:01,"I hope this doesn't sound selfish, because I'd rather the spread of this virus is slowed, even if it is disruptive.

I am off work until April 6th, at which point the situation is to be reassessed. I work with a child with high needs in a city-run daycare, and we are located in a public school. Another city daycare in a school here is apparently being closed until June, and it's looking like Ontario schools may be closed until the start of September, meaning daycares in schools likely will be too. So I am potentially off work for a few months.

It has actually been pretty nice, I've been exercising and painting, but we weren't given any emergency pay and only found out last Friday that we would be closed for three weeks, so I'm waiting for EI benefits.

So here's my timeline of frustration, that has now been extended:

June 2019 - I made a Dr.'s appointment to get a referral for my mental health issues, he suspected BP, but wanted a psychiatrist to confirm, he gave me an antidepressant that really messed me up, I lost all touch with reality and my body, it felt like my head was full of frantic bees, I have DPDR, so I'm used to it, but this was way more extreme. Three weeks later I go back and he forgot to make the referral and said he would this time.

September 2019 - I get a call asking if I'm showing up to the referral clinic's information session (they apparently mailed me the date and time, but I didn't receive anything) so I reschedule for the 1st option in October

October 2019 - 30 minute information session that didn't apply to me because I was a referral client

November 2019 - I get in to see a psychologist finally, who diagnosed my with BP2 and PTSD, she tells me to see my Dr. for a prescription

January 2020 - I see my Dr., he tells me I need a psychiatric consult with the clinic for medication, so I call and apparently I'm on a waitlist

March 19, 2020 was supposed to be my appointment and they called to cancel, said I would get a call next month to reschedule. It's been close to a year now since my initial referral. I just want some help, I've been getting worse since I got the diagnosis. Right now, I just want stability, for the first time since diagnosis I actually want to be on medication. I just want to be normal. I want to know my mood will stay around the same and I won't scare people with my anger and mood swings anymore. 

I just wanted to put this somewhere, I feel so worn down by this process, and it seems like the world is falling apart. The pandemic is bringing all the intrusive thoughts from OCD that I had learned to control back in full force. Now I'm constantly terrified that my family is going to get sick and die, and like I need to control everything my mom does so she's safe, even though they live 16 hours away.

I hope everyone is okay and staying safe, things are pretty wild right now, I hope you guys are staying (somewhat) sane.",hope sound selfish rather spread virus slowed even disruptive work april 6th point situation reassessed work child high needs daycare located public school another city daycare school apparently closed june looking like ontario schools may closed start september meaning daycares schools likely potentially work months actually pretty nice exercising painting given emergency pay found last friday would closed three weeks waiting ei benefits timeline frustration extended june 2019 made appointment get referral mental health issues suspected bp wanted psychiatrist confirm gave antidepressant really messed lost touch reality body felt like head full frantic bees dpdr used way extreme three weeks later go back forgot make referral said would time september 2019 get call asking showing referral clinic information session apparently mailed date time receive anything reschedule 1st option october october 2019 30 minute information session apply referral client november 2019 get see psychologist finally diagnosed bp2 ptsd tells see prescription january 2020 see tells need psychiatric consult clinic medication call apparently waitlist march 19 2020 supposed appointment called cancel said would get call next month reschedule close year since initial referral want help getting worse since got diagnosis right want stability first time since diagnosis actually want medication want normal want know mood stay around wo scare people anger mood swings anymore wanted put somewhere feel worn process seems like world falling apart pandemic bringing intrusive thoughts ocd learned control back full force constantly terrified family going get sick die like need control everything mom safe even though live 16 hours away hope everyone okay staying safe things pretty wild right hope guys staying somewhat sane

* I have my own space
* I walk on the beach at sunset almost every evening
* I finally have an eating schedule, and am back to a healthy weight
* I make enough money to survive
* I have kind and humble friends in all walks of life
* I now take my med everyday (I was very spotty for years)
* I’m grateful that I only have to take one med (Lamictal)

Life is good. I never thought I could create this good of a situation especially when I lost everything 3 years ago (business, home, dog, fiancé of 7 years, physical & emotional health…), due to COVID times/mega long hypomanic episode with a garnish of adderall. But I did it.

I have peace, but I don’t have:

* motivation
* drive
* curiosity
* emotional depth
* desire
* a reliable short term memory

I used to be the highly driven, crazy work ethic person. I had wild, groundbreaking ideas and could execute them. I had the adhd curiosity. I had the ability to hyperfocus outside of work and the desire to learn as much as I could about the world.

Of course, we all know the bad in there:

* over 500 all nighters
* a very long list of lovers
* substance abuse
* very unhealthy eating/unintentionally starving myself/not prioritizing basic human needs
* …and on and on

So, I don’t want to go back there. But there has to an in between. Right? There has to be.

I don’t want to languish for the rest of my life. I don’t want to “just survive” and waste my life in retail/service jobs.

I want to be a productive member of society. I want to grow. I want to have at least a little bit of motivation & curiosity about the world.

I’ve never been this stable though. I’ve never wanted to try going off meds so bad. I miss my brain.

If the neurotypicals can’t have it all, then it seems like we can’t either.

But do I already have it? Am I a fool to think that life would be better with just a little less medication? A little more spark? A little more joie de vivre? I want to sparkle again, just not so shiny, and with a curfew.

Hey, I’m Bipolar type I and I do not work and I cannot work. 

I am 32, rent my own 1 bed flat, and I am on full disability benefits, housing benefits and PIP (Uk)

I want all of you to know, if you are the same as me please don’t give yourself a hard time and think you should be working.

Bipolar is classed as a disability, in both the states and UK.

If you are in the UK, there is a reason why you were put in the venerable category for Covid jabs. A family member was even confused as to why I got my jabs way before them. It’s because bipolar disorder IS a disability.

You are fully eligible to apply for any disability funding. You are well within for right to ask for any additional support to be referred to through your doctors.

Ignore anyone who starts to reference any celebrities/doctors/scientists who constantly work that have bipolar. This is not a blanket statement that should be taken as fact.

Please believe me when I say that most humans with bipolar are unable to work at all. When you take that into account - anyjob roles I referenced are perhaps maybe 15% of all bipolar humans that have actually managed to gain a career and wealth. 

I often think of how much I could offer and be if I was able to access a private doctor but I understand and acknowledge that will never be the case.

EDIT - before I had a psychotic manic break, I was an inventory manager for American Apparel for 5 years, then an office manager for a large design agency, I was on an incredible career path and it all got taken away from me. Having said that, looking back, I am so incredibly proud of what I achieved (at a young age too!!)

We packed the car, planned it all out, figured it’d be a nice weekend just put ourselves in nature then we’d return to work after the weekend. I work remotely so I brought my laptop “just in case” something went wrong.

We get to the state park. There’s some kind of fall festival going on and it’s clearly not COVID safe. I half-seriously state, “We can always go to Montana and see Glacier National Park.”

And windy. So windy that we can’t setup camp.

“Let’s rent a cabin, just for tonight, so we can get some good sleep. We don’t want to go manic.”

A night turns into four more nights in the cabin because “I need the Internet access to work.”

We finally decide to leave, adding room to the journey home for five days of travel because, “We shouldn’t drive too much each day. We don’t want to go manic.”

We triumphantly drive 2000 miles home over the course of five days, as scheduled. We high five that we’re responsible adults in our thirties and definitely not manic.

bipolar,1jtqn8a,2025-04-07 22:45:31,"TL DR: How did you recover from psychosis? How did it “feel” when you began recovering? And how did you know the psychosis was gone? 


For context, I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, OCD, and PTSD.  I am medicated. I have had COVID related psychosis in the past and am pretty good at realizing when I’m hallucinating. 

My psychosis was triggered by the loss of a loved one and a mixed episode. It started with auditory hallucinations (which I’ve experienced before), disorganized thinking, delusions, and olfactory hallucinations. Things got scarier when I started to see a shadow peer at me around corners, so immediately called my doctor and he put me on Seroquel. 

Since then, it’s been a battle. The Seroquel is working, but it’s still no picnic. I have lapses in memory, “lose time” constantly, I’m virtually unable to care for myself, scared, and riddled with compulsions from my OCD. I’ve even given myself frost nip on my face from the amount of ice dunks I’ve done in attempt to ground myself in reality. 

It’s been over a month of this and I’m so tired. Every morning I wake up thinking “Todays the day I go back to normal.” But it doesn’t happen.

For anyone who went through psychosis, was there a day when you were suddenly better? If not, how did you recover? What did recovery feel like? Could you even tell that you were getting better?

bipolar,1ixb30p,2025-02-25 01:19:13,"Hi y'all - I feel like a failure. I'm in my late 20's and I've just gone back to school to do something I want to do. But I need to apply for my program, I've noticed that my table mates have much more beautiful/concise work than me. I know I need to work harder, but I feel stuck. It's making me anxious. However, something that keeps me going is we are hand drawing, which is pretty outdated for the field I'm going into and I actually have decent experience with 3D modeling which is what we'll be doing. 

My cohort from my first college went on to be extremely successful. But I tell myself their rich parents set them up (which they did). 

Additionally, my resume is a mess. I graduated from my first undergrad during covid and was basically given a bad hand since. And then I went into an industry that is infamous for its job instability, aggressive management, and sabotaging coworkers. It makes good money and I LOVED the job, but... I've considered lying on my resume... 

I've been thinking about doing some freelance work. I have decent skills, but they're not spectacular nor do I know how to network. 

I want to do so much, but feel like I have no time... but I have gotten re-addicted to my phone. 

I'm desperate and committed to being better financially and professionally.

I really want to own a laundry mat (I know random - I have my reasons lol) for some passive income. But idk how to look at those profit margins. I also want to buy random land and turn them into yoga retreats or something hippish - maybe employing small local bands. 

Idk I have so many ambitions and feel like I have no resources. I need a mentor and want money. I feel like people don't want to be my mentor because they get irritated with me. I'm kinda hyper and really bubbly. Come off as ditzy a lot. No one takes me seriously. I've had people tell me that, they initially thought I was stupid but it turns out that I'm the most intelligent person they've met. This is a hella hot take... but I have a valley girl accent, am told I look 20, blonde, pretty (come on yall, I feel like people try to tear down pretty women), and I smile a lot. When I ask older women questions, they're terse. When I ask older men questions, they're sexual. 

I feel like I need to lock-in but I feel like I lack the intelligence/capabilities to make anything succeed. :(

bipolar,1jhyzqj,2025-03-23 18:44:23,"I'm 31F. When i was 16 I had been experiencing anxiety, depression for a while and then suffered psychosis. I got help and was diagnosed with bipolar (cant remember if it was I or II). I was medicated until I was around 22. I took myself off my medication which I know is not the right way to go about it.

i was always very moody as a child and as a teenager I noticed periods of pro longed high or low moods.

Ever since I stopped the medication, I felt I was only dealing with depression but I had found ways to deal with that side of things.

I'm now 31. For the past 18 months I've been dealing with low or high moods but it can change throughout the day. I do have periods of say 2-3 weeks of higher moods mixed with low moods and then 2-3 weeks of low moods but mixed with some good days. The moods aren't as extreme as they were when I was younger where it was a solid 6 weeks of extreme low and then I'd wake up one day and it was an extreme high for a few weeks.

I'm also dealing with depression, some anxiety, irritability, loss of direction in life, feeling like there's no point, I'm even at the point in the low moods where I feel so awful but I can't even cry about it whereas younger me used to cry so much when I was in the low moods.

I spoke to my friend about it who's actually a psychologist and we spoke on a friend level about it, not like she was actually my psychologist. But one thing she said to me about being unmedicated was that maybe I have just discovered ways to deal with it without medication.

Maybe i was in denial about the bipolar diagnosis. I felt like it didn't apply to me anymore and this friend did also mention that maybe it was a misdiagnosis at the time as I was so young and it can be difficult to articulate what I'm actually feeling. (Again, this wasn't a professional opinion, this was just something she suggested as a friend venting to a friend)

However the changes I've experienced in the last 18 months have led me down the path of wondering if I have ADHD as I definitely relate to a lot of the symptoms and a friend of mine has ADHD and when she relayed how her mind works to me, I felt like she was reading my mind!

I went to my GP to get a referral to my therapist and when I mentioned that I wasn't medicated but had a diagnosis of bipolar , he was shocked. And it's made me think maybe bipolar has been a bigger issue in my life recently than I realised.

So I'm going to my therapist this week to discuss the possibility of this being bipolar still, not ADHD, and the possibility of being referred to a psychiatrist.

Has anyone got any advice, thoughts or experience not being medicated? I just want to know if bipolar is something people can live with and not be medicated as now I'm worried about that aspect of it.

bipolar,1jfnh03,2025-03-20 17:44:08,"I’m 55.  My first diagnosis for Bipolar was sometime when I was in college.  I dismissed it as,”The Dr clearly didn’t know what he was talking about”. I stuck with my anxiety/depression diagnosis because that made the most sense to me and it was a diagnosis I could easily understand. The only problem was it wasn’t enough. There was something more that needed to be addressed. I knew that.  In 2015 I had a hospitalization from an irrational overdose of medication that was meant to cover up a paranoid episode brought on by smoking weed (no one new I started smoking weed for the first time and I was forty years old!) thinking back I felt like I was depressed and mania at the same time or my moods were switching rapidly if that’s even possible. During that time I also got my first tattoo and took motorcycle lessons, not that any of that is bad but the level of hyperfixation was not normal. Even with the hospital stay the Bipolar was not brought up because I said it was a suicide attempt and not an intentional overdose.  I am so ashamed of this, its not a highlight of my life. In 2020 I was hospitalized again due to anxiety and depression brought on by the stress teaching middle school during Covid.  I was even considering going out on disability. It could have been depression from the Bipolar but I’m not sure. Around that time I was diagnosed again with bipolar after seeing a psychiatrist for the first time regularly for my anxiety and depression.  The manic episodes started to become more evident and I still would not fully accept this diagnosis.   I would maybe, somewhat accept it to be Bipolar 2 and not Bipolar 1 ( that’s what crazy people had, lol) I didn’t and still don’t understand it fully. 

The biggest thing I don’t understand is my mania.  I don’t run around the house laughing, I don’t have crazy, risky sex, I don’t stay up late at night cleaning my house and I was going to say didn’t have sleeping problems but then I remembered the nights of racing thoughts-so yeah. But I do have extremely impulsive moments that make me spend money on the most stupid stuff.  I have hyperfixation that disrupts my life.  I’ll fixate on one hobby or idea that consumes everything and right now it’s multiple hobbies since I just retired.  I’ve gotten myself completely overwhelmed. Sourdough, crocheting, Minecraft, Gardening, reading, substituting and an additional part time job along with additional activities and interests that I’m researching.   I literally stand in the middle of my living room frozen because I don’t know what to do. 

So that brings me to now. I have a fantastic new Psychiatrist who agreed I needed a through neurological evaluation to finally see what was going on.  I was insisting I had ADHD and not Bipolar and I wanted to make sure I was taking the right medication. I met with the psychiatrist who read the results just two days ago and his diagnosis for the third time is clearly Bipolar, anxiety and depression and also PTSD (childhood trauma-that’s a whole different story for another time). I do not have ADHD at all. So now I’m just trying to embrace and understand. I have a new therapist that I will meet with next week and I just need to finally be okay with all this. I think I need to comprehend that Bipolar is different for everyone and even though I don’t have all the symptoms I have enough to make this diagnosis valid. Is this the way?

bipolar,1j4vpkd,2025-03-06 19:12:07,"I got diagnosed almost 2 years ago during my freshman year of college and had to withdraw entirely this past October because I was having constant mental breakdowns to the point where I genuinely couldn't even open my laptop without crying. I'm a classic case of gifted kid burnout; I almost didn't graduate high school but hung on by a thread thanks to covid, and took a year off before starting university, but each semester got harder and harder and I even relapsed over school in the spring which felt so ridiculous to me and I knew I needed a break.

But since Kindergarten I was praised for my academic abilities, even after my first semester at university I got invited to join the honors program and I made the dean's list my first 5 semesters by having a 3.7+ gpa. But right now I don't feel ready to go back to college. I'm working at Chipotle making good enough money to support myself at the moment but I live in a cheap apartment and don't know how I would advance my life by staying at this place.

It's conflicting because I honestly have a lot of fun at my job, plus with the food being not terrible for me it genuinely feeds me almost everyday and if I didn't work here I would have much unhealthier eating habits, and either blow all my money on fast food or starve. My managers also have told me they want to promote me to a kitchen leader and maybe even service leader which would come with a decent raise, but then what? As much as I enjoy working in a restaurant right now I don't know if that's what I want to spend my whole life doing; work my way up to potentially become a gm either at my current job or elsewhere?

The thought of that doesn't sound that unappealing though honestly. But I feel like a lot of people in my life would be disappointed if I don't go back to school, and I know it'll never too late to go back but right now I just feel like I really never want to. Even if one day I change my mind I just can't put school in the picture for me.

This became kind of a long yap but I'd just like to hear if anybody else is dealing with this too or has been through it, and if anyone has any success stories that don't involve going to university?

bipolar,1iwar4c,2025-02-23 19:30:05,"Hi everyone,

I think I should say this is a throwaway account. I'm bipolar and currently in treatment. Therapy took me out of suicidal thoughts and helped me stabilize when I was adapting to the meds, so now I'm here. The goal of this post is to vent and ask for advice because the way things go idk I feel like I will be miserable forever, even if that makes no logical sense, and I know it makes no sense. I'm feeling really stuck and could use some advice.

I'm a software engineer in Portugal, earning just a bit over minimum wage. My job is draining, and I feel helpless. My wife is unemployed and studying, so quitting isn't an option. I love and I want to support her in her quest too.

Although I've been way worse, and it's been months since I had mania or suicidal thoughts.  I'm exhausted most days, which stops me from moving on, you know, learning things that could actually take me away from this situation. I know I should just sit down for 30 minutes a day to study something else like full-stack development, something all my friends suggested, and idk 30 more minutes to apply for jobs on linkedin, but I feel anxious and disgusted whenever I open my PC at home. I can't bring myself to study or code outside work for even five minutes without feeling paralyzed.

Honestly, I don't think I'm a good dev. The framework I work with is really niche, and I never had formal education in the field. I tried going to college for computer science before I had the diagnosis, and I quit after a depressive episode and plummeting in every subject. Then I went to biology, something I still enjoy, and then COVID came and I had to get a job so I quit that too.

Also, applying for jobs on LinkedIn is the most depressing thing ever. Everyone has impossible standards and posts toxic fake nonsense generated by GPT with the same ""higienyzed"" marketing voice. When I finally get to an interview, nobody has barely even read my CV, and they all ask questions like ""do you know absolutely everything?"" because they have very little idea of what we actually do as devs. Then, I get to a technical challenge that I feel absolutely crushed by because I haven't been studying over the past months to be able to do them.

I've considered other paths. I write okay despite this rant, but never had the courage to write a book, and the effort scares me. I've started and gave up on several blogs about different topics. I've been a cashier, a biology lab tech, and a clerk in a healthcare unit (which was okay), but I was miserable in all of them.

Most of the time, I feel like I don't fit anywhere, that the way other people live is just soulcrushing and slowly gets to me. I've been in this job for over one year now, longer than any other I've been, and I already want to quit. Sometimes I think I should go back to my family to rest and build myself up again, but that feels like failure, and it is an irrational illusion anyway. I left my parents for many reasons – we were never happy together, my country is violent and full of inequalities, and I'd rather not go back to that.

Has anyone been in a similar situation of just not fitting? Of feeling the need to better yourself, but now managing to? How did you find a way out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

bipolar,1i0ngdn,2025-01-14 01:47:12,"There’s so much that has occurred in my relationship that got us to rhis point, we have been together for over 5 years now. Pre-COVID even. 

My boyfriend and I live together and we have a very happy life together. But lately I have been angry at him and it makes it hard for feel the usual fondess I do for him. 

I started being angry one day about 3 weeks ago when I saw that he liked the picture of this girl we both follow on instagram, and it was nothing bad or anything but I got irrationally angry feeling like he never bothers to like my own pictures (not entirely true but what I felt ) and so I unfollowed him and removed him from my account , feeling that I’ll at least feel like if he can’t even see what I post, he can’t ignore it by choice. But then I began to feel angry again about these photos he has of him and his ex on his page. 

The shitty on my end thing is that this woman passed away suddenly at only 32. The photos are sweet many of them together and a close up of her eyes, and the caption is heart felt as fuck. In the 5 years we’ve been together he has never posted me and I feel like I’m overshadowed by a very important ghost. At least online. 

I’ve brought it up, and many times the conversation gets very emotional. He has said many times before that he wanted to post us and eventually would but this was already a while ago. This time when he mentioned it I said “no I don’t believe you and even if you did at this point is not even because you want to but because I told you.” 

He says that online doesn’t matter but real life does and we are doing so good , and he is right, I really really want to shake this bitter feeling I feel about our relationship with instagram as a couple. 

The fact that I’ve had to battle with with on and off for 5 years almost is exhausting to me. I hope that shouting it into this void can maybe help me feel heard or something. I know it isn’t quite bipolar related but I and someone who has battled with bipolar and I think maybe the level of rumination I’m having can be a part of it. 

Anyways if you’re feeling that I am immature and need a talking to, please take it a little easy on me. I know you’re right but I am very sensitive .

bipolar,1dyh77u,2024-07-09 00:38:46,"I don’t know where to even begin. I finally received a diagnosis of Bipolar I. The reason why I say finally is because I’ve been asking professionals for over a decade if I have it. My brother has it. But even before I knew he had it, I knew something was off. The clinical depression diagnosis I had as a kid never really seemed to fit. 

I was then diagnosed about 4 years ago with C-PTSD. But my therapist says that wasn’t correct. Perhaps it was somewhat of my fault to get this diagnosis at 36 years old, perhaps I wasn’t being honest enough.

My therapist advised me to quit my job because I worked in a nursing home, constantly surrounded by death. The fact that we are understaffed constantly since the beginning of the COVID pandemic and the fast pace environment triggered my mania, among other things in my life. So I’m scrambling for the past few weeks, trying to get on social security and find some source of income. I feel absolutely broken right now. I’ve been irritable, lashing out, then crying. Oh and to top it all off I had to bury my darling beloved cat yesterday. So I’m even more of a mess. They increased my dose of lamotrigine since the diagnosis and also put me on 50 mg of quetiapine. It’s helping me sleep, but I’m still adjusting.

Half of me was shocked to get the diagnosis just because it’s always shocking to hear a new diagnosis I guess. But the other half of me felt somewhat validated. I’ve been doing a lot of reflection, looking back on certain parts in my life and realizing I was probably manic, especially in my early twenties.

bipolar,1ih653q,2025-02-04 07:03:34,"anyone experience frequent crying when inconsistent w/ meds?

hi (: so i'm diagnosed type 1 with psychotic features since frebruary 2020.

i'll admit these past few months i've been in a depressive episode fluctuating between mild and severe. because of this, i've started to become inconsistent with my mood stabilizer. lately, i've found myself being easily triggered into sobbing uncontrollably by seemingly insignificant events. 

for example, i was messing around with my boyfriend last night playing with a soccer ball in the living room. i played for eight years and was really good at it. it was my passion. because of covid, my senior season got cut short and i haven't played on a team since. during our unserious 1v1 defensive situation, he ended up ""megging"" me (kicking the ball between my legs, iykyk) and started laughing about how he was finally able to do it to me.

at first it was funny but then i increasingly became emotional. i started quickly withdrawing, sat down on the couch and when he asked what was wrong, i just started sobbing. i don't know why but the whole thing just caused so much pain. i told him how what happened reminded me of how rusty i am with the sport and how it was such a huge part of my identity. it was something that gave me a leg-up in the high school social scene as an ""overweight"" girl. i always thought people wouldn't view me as the associated stereotype (i.e. lazy, unfit, etc.) because i was an athlete. and now since i don't do it anymore and i've gained weight for other reasons, i'm just reduced to being defined by my weight.

he apologized profusely about ""taking the joke to far"" and promising not to do it anymore. but i kept telling him how i didn't know why i was crying and it had nothing to do with him.

stuff like this has been going on for the past few weeks and i don't know why. can anyone relate?",anyone experience frequent crying inconsistent meds hi diagnosed type 1 psychotic features since frebruary admit past months depressive episode fluctuating mild severe started become inconsistent mood stabilizer lately found easily triggered sobbing uncontrollably seemingly insignificant events example messing around boyfriend last night playing soccer ball living room played eight years really good passion covid senior season got cut short played team since unserious 1v1 defensive situation ended megging kicking ball legs iykyk started laughing finally able first funny increasingly became emotional started quickly withdrawing sat couch asked wrong started sobbing know whole thing caused much pain told happened reminded rusty sport huge part identity something gave high school social scene overweight girl always thought people would view associated stereotype lazy unfit etc athlete since anymore gained weight reasons reduced defined weight apologized profusely taking joke far promising anymore kept telling know crying nothing stuff like going past weeks know anyone relate
bipolar,1ejuib3,2024-08-04 18:21:11,"BP1 here, and this spring I had a moderate episode in which I threatened to sue my employer, told coworkers they were conspiring against me, and ripped the hitch wiring off my RV out of stupidity and being distracted by the illness. But also: I was permanently hungover the entire time.

I think in the past twenty years the longest I’ve been sober was five days and that was Covid. I’ve been a functional alcoholic: high paying remote job where I could start drinking at 2pm and no one could tell. I’d drink heavy (5-6 7% IPAs) til 8pm, then finish off with some water so the headache wasn’t too bad the next day. All this time I kept having severe recurring depression in which all I wanted was to kms.

The morning I broke the RV hitch I was hung over and depressed, and something snapped in me: I wasn’t going to drink anymore. As my doctor had been telling me, I wasn’t giving the chance for the meds to work if I’m piling on depressants every days. So I quit cold turkey: no support groups, just my wife and willpower. 

First few days sucked. Dopamine and sugar crash made the lingering depression worse. There was no “reward” awaiting me at 2pm. By the end of the week, however, my depression had mostly subsided.

It’s been two months now, something I never thought I’d be able to do, and it turns out the meds work better this way too. I’m more present. Waking up still sucks because I’m old AF and my body hurts, but knowing that I won’t be hungover is huge. The biggest battle has been boredom from where I used to fill in time with alcohol.

Point I’m trying to make is that if are having trouble with your meds but you are drinking all the time, you aren’t giving yourself a fair chance at recovery and stability.

bipolar,1iojbe9,2025-02-13 19:13:24,"I’m 22 and currently in treatment for bipolar disorder type 2. I started having symptoms at 15 but wasn’t diagnosed until 18. Between 18 and 22, I had little to no proper care, but now I’m on 200 mg lamotrigine and have monthly sessions with a bipolar-specialized nurse. A lot has improved (ended a toxic relationship, better relationships with family/friends, got into uni), but studying and sleeping are still a disaster. Which makes further recovery difficult.

I desperately want to do well, but I procrastinate everything and get average grades, even though I know I’m capable of more. This fills me with stress and self-hatred. Before COVID, I excelled—math Olympiads, top 3 in my class every year. Now my life is chaotic: I forget appointments, I’m always late, I burn my food, and sometimes I can’t even process what people are saying. People see me as an ""airhead,"" and are surprised I study chemical engineering.

I thought this might be ADHD, but I was diagnosed *not* having it in 2024. However, at the time, I wasn’t on the right medication for bipolar disorder, and I disagree with the outcome. My nurse was dismissive at first but eventually agreed to schedule a second opinion. But recently, she told me I ""can’t have ADHD if I’m high-functioning"" and that I’m just using ADHD as an ""excuse"" for not performing at my old level. It feels like she doesn’t believe in me.

Then I was invited to a catch up hosted by some of my uni friends. I wasn’t going to go because I’d been so depressed but I went for a few hours. I spoke about bipolar and later wished I hadn’t.

Then my mum was visiting from interstate but she was helping me with my moderately hoarded house and we were working everyday. On Mother’s Day, I took her somewhere I always wanted to go and we had the best time. It was the only day all year when I felt relaxed and truely happy.

I also visited my partner for about a week and that was nice but I’m not really counting it as I was still working, really stressed about money and I had gastro and covid.

bipolar,1f143kd,2024-08-26 00:35:25,"Hi everyone! I want to thank this community for helping me not feel alone.  I want to share my story since I never met another bipolar person in my life who could relate to me.

After struggling with depression since 12 & being hospitalized for 3 attempts over the years, I finally reached a great place in my life at 27.  I was engaged to my best friend & soul mate.  I had a great job, was physically fit, mentally sound, good with my family, and generally loved myself and my life.  I was a outgoing & social person who could make with friends with anyone.

In Dec 2019 I had my first manic episode which ended in Jan 2021 when I was hospitalized and diagnosed with BP 1.  It began when I suddenly and without reason ended my engagement. I immediately joined dating apps and was going out and hooking up with people.  I later caused an incident at work which caused me to get fired eventually.  During peak Covid I traveled all over the country.  I spent 80k that year on myself, gifts, traveling, etc.  I did many other reckless and dangerous things like most manic episodes I've read, but never got in trouble. I felt unstoppable while ruining my life. 

After it ended, I had another attempt and since have spent last 4 years living with my mom and haven't worked & became a recluse.  Life doesn't seem real to me because of depersonalization & derealization.  I have constant SI and just have given up. I've been on numerous combinations of medications over past 4 years.  I just can't let go of who I was, who I am now, and who I could have been.  These thoughts are a cancer of my mind.

2 Questions:

1. I am blessed with a very vivid memory which is a blessing & curse.  I constantly have intrusive memories (good & bad) pop up in my head like a movie skipping to random scenes of my life. Does anyone else experience this?  
2. How do we move on when we know we can't be as happy as were? Why live by accepting that you can't ever strive to be too happy for the fear of losing it all again?

bipolar,1g417ae,2024-10-15 11:41:42,"Oh god. I don’t even know where or how to start. 

I’m in Florida and while my home is safe, my job is not. The hospital at which I work is flooded. I can’t specify too much for obvious reasons, but I work on a specialized team that is contracted by the hospital, and due to the damage (and the cost of my team), the program is being cut. 

Found out today that my fiancé’s job doesn’t have enough money to reopen after the storm. So we’re both unemployed. 

I have the opportunity (kind of) to interview at a hospital where I used to work. Two issues:
1. The other candidate is my current coworker who is also out of a job, with four kids, and is two years my senior in terms of experience at this hospital. I met her originally at this hospital where she trained me, to put it in perspective.
2. I was manic as fuck while I was there. It was COVID, and I was in the COVID unit frequently performing ECMOs, and what that is doesn’t matter. The point was, I wasn’t sleeping, I was always in fight or flight, people were dying, and my charge nurse was driving me up a fucking wall. We fought often, partly because she was making the wrong calls but mostly because I was off my rocker and pissed off for any reason at all. 

Well, this charge nurse is now the unit manager who will be conducting my interview. My best friend who still works there was approached by her and was asked “why did (my name) leave???  I feel like it was on bad terms.” So I know she’s going to ask me. 

The reason I left was because I was at the top of the parking garage trying to will myself over the edge. Thank god I won that battle, but I went to my (then) manager and said “Something is wrong, I need help because all I want to do is die and I think working here is the reason.” My manager at the time hugged me and cried with me while I figured out a plan. She didn’t end my employment for two weeks after, to make it look like I put in notice, but everybody kind of knew what was going on. 

There were other issues, but the main issue will be my interviewer tomorrow, and my competition is somebody more worthy, and I am now a 0 income household with a $2.3k monthly rent. That’s just rent.

I had to be hospitalized due to ideation, and then I had to reduce my work hours, and now I can't keep a job longer than 3 months. Sometimes I'm lucky to even get to the 3 month mark.

The session was more of an introductory sesh, didnt delve much into the past but more on focusing on my habits and how it’s affecting my life and mood now. Was given a task on mindfulness, praising myself for doing the bare minimum.

First of all, i've been recently diagnosed and everything is a little strange and foggy for me, my country dosent really offer GREAT mental health services, so i feel a little lost. For most of my life i just tought i had depression, but after my father death due to covid i went thourgh a series of exams: first i was diagnosed with ADHD, then depression and then finally, BPD Type 2. Im taking my meds but sometimes i just cant afford it.

  
Well, to the topic at hand: My friends at most dont seem to mind, but i have a fear that someday they will just get tired off and distance themselves from me. due to the depressive episodes i've gone thourgh weeks and month without seem them and i have a fear the'll think i dont like to hang with them or something.

  
My Family... is more complicated, after my father died it was just me and my Mom. Thing seem to work, mostly. She is a complicated and had a serie of serious health problems. She cant work anymore so i take the load off her as a Video Editor.I love her, and she loves me, but she critizes me for ""being too weak, too sad"" and ""thinking too much like a woman sometimes""

  
And finally, the reason i came to post here: Before the diagnose i started dating this girl. She seemed perfect, we have so much im common, we used to talk a lot, see each other a lot. she's diagnosed with depression, so i guess we found some common ground in our melancholy. But she grew a little distant, even forggeting my birthday while i was in the hospital, so i guess i grew a little resentful, shee seemed to be so happy with other people but never wanted to hang out with my, so one day, in the middle of a crisis, i lash out on her, and she still seems to hate me for it. I tried to explain to her that i was not in a good headspace and i was vomiting feelings i held with me for so long, and something were just non-logical decisions that my head took from the fear she would leave me, but she didnt seem to understand.

  
Anyways, sry for bad english (not my first language) but i wanted to know how to deal with people around me. Mostly so i dont hurt them, since i dont think they'll ever understand what goes thourgh my head. How do i comunicate myself better with people around me?",friendships family mostly romantic first recently diagnosed everything little strange foggy country dosent really offer great mental health services feel little lost life tought depression father death due covid went thourgh series exams first diagnosed adhd depression finally bpd type im taking meds sometimes cant afford well topic hand friends dont seem mind fear someday get tired distance due depressive episodes gone thourgh weeks month without seem fear think dont like hang something family complicated father died mom thing seem work mostly complicated serie serious health problems cant work anymore take load video love loves critizes weak sad thinking much like woman sometimes finally reason came post diagnose started dating girl seemed perfect much im common used talk lot see lot diagnosed depression guess found common ground melancholy grew little distant even forggeting birthday hospital guess grew little resentful shee seemed happy people never wanted hang one day middle crisis lash still seems hate tried explain good headspace vomiting feelings held long something decisions head took fear would leave didnt seem understand anyways sry bad english first language wanted know deal people around mostly dont hurt since dont think ever understand goes thourgh head comunicate better people around
bipolar,1gtiwks,2024-11-17 23:07:14,"Just diagnosed. Not sure how to feel 

Hi. I’m a 21 f and I’ve just been given my second diagnosis of bipolar II. I’m really frustrated but also relieved. Here’s a bit of my story.

When I was 18 I started college at a top university here in the US. Super prestigious and I worked my ass off since I was 13 to get there, swearing off any and all fun and enjoyment. 

COVID hit my junior year of HS. I went from a super innocent girl, to all the sudden smoking dab pens every day, all the time. It was so hard to cope with all the loss I faced that year.

Anyways when I entered my freshman year of college I had just quit smoking and went through CHS, which is essentially when your body cannot deal with you quitting weed. I threw up everyday and was super underweight and so anxious I don’t even know how I survived.

When I finally got settled into school, I started to embrace having fun and started smoking again. It all snowballed, and the final blow was me being jumped by a homeless person. It wasn’t even the actual crime, but how everyone I cared about responded. Nobody gave a shit.

Anyways, I soon entered my first of eventually 3 manic episodes that occurred within the last 3 years. 

I had shitty therapists and psychiatrists. I was on and off 10 different meds over the last few years. 

I had to leave my dream school after two years. By that point, I had endured an extremely dangerous relationship where I was relentlessly abused and manipulated by a man who was a diagnosed narcissist.

I lost every friend I ever had. My family almost disowned me. I have been through hell and back. I came close to being hospitalized twice and dealt with relentless SI and almost attempted. Don’t even know how I’m here today honestly. 

I’m leaving out a lot of the crazy manic stories, because they could each take up pages and pages of detail lol. But they were bad. Real bad.

I’ve also dealt with extremely intense depressive episodes. I’m normally a talkative, somewhat outgoing person. I’ve had many depressive episodes that have lasted up to 6 months. Consisting of no showering, no talking, no thoughts. I was a shell of a person. Nothing.

I’m been given previous diagnoses of BPD and bipolar before. I related to both, but BPD never seemed to explain my cycles of depression and mania.

I was depressed most of this summer, but not as bad as my previous episodes. 

After so much trauma therapy and hard work, I’ve reached a point of relative stability despite the depression. 

But I finally found a therapist who specializes in bipolar. I reached out because I’m afraid. I am so terrified of being manic again. Over the last year I’ve worked so hard to get where I am. 

I’m in a loving year long relationship. Me and my parents are in a really good place. I’ve started to go back to school.

But I’m started to feel happy again. More energy. And I’m just so scared. I feel like nobody understands this. So I’m finally trying to access a community of where maybe I can find similar experiences.

Im feeling a mix of emotions now.

I’m hoping I can prevent anymore manic or depressive episodes from derailing my life. I’m hoping this diagnosis can help me keep myself safe. I’m just scared.

bipolar,1h0o6fz,2024-11-27 03:32:59,"i’m feeling frustrating and want to vent/hear similar experiences.
I’ve been on my current mood stabilizer for 4.5 years and despite my bp1 diagnosis and a previous severe mania, have been relatively stable since. I have had some ups and down, and am currently dealing with a hypomania that I’m finding uncomfortable, undesirable, more extreme. I even took some ‘emergency’ meds to bring down the mania, which hasn’t been necessary since early 2021 (it helped a lot and i’m feeling more balanced than i was for the two weeks before this).
I cant get my psychs recent comment out of my head, though. She said “i’ve been seeing you a year and this is the second time you’ve been hypomanic like this. Ideally, i wouldn’t want you to experience anything like this while medicated. It’s making me consider tapering you onto a different mood stabilizer.” That feels bonkers to me, and very black and white. I should /never/ have an episode while medicated? That doesnt feel realistic… Am i delulu for feeling like being a bit racey for a couple weeks isn’t a huge deal?
For now, I am taking care of myself, my sleep, lowering caffeine intake and doing my best to think through my actions, no impulsiveness etc. I do not want to change meds, as I currently have low side effects and dont want to risk that changing.

bipolar,1g7ho7w,2024-10-20 01:46:50,"Heyo, unfortunately I’ve been going through a really difficult time recently. A very traumatic event and is re traumatizing. 

I’ve been handling things well, I was scared I was reverting and my year of progress was going to be for nothing. I’ve worked very hard and I did feel myself slipping and felt like I was spiraling.

One remnant thing that has been bothersome is that I realized that people don’t think like me and it’s become abundantly clear. I’ve unfortunately gone through many traumatic events in quick secession (SA, multiple friends killing themselves during Covid, and my own attempt).

Clearly there is understandable survival rewiring, and that just sucks in tandem with bipolar.

I recently moved and started my transfer to a new clinic and I’m not happy about it. 

I really liked my last therapist and psychiatrist, and I’ve only met my new psychiatrist. I could tell by her body language and the way she looked at me that something wasn’t right. Maybe she doesn’t think I’m bipolar.

My old therapist has confirmed many times that I am in fact bipolar, however, there is periodical doubt. I’ve never considered stopping my meds so don’t fret about that.

What if I’m not bipolar, what if I just can’t handle the things that everyone else can. What if I’m just crazy, making things up, and maybe ive just been lying so much to myself I convinced myself I’m bipolar and I’m actually just someone seeking attention.

What I just have CPTSD and not bipolar, what if I secretly wanted to be ill. 

I don’t know, due to recent events I’ve had to see so many counselors and I have just realized that the things I tell them, they don’t seem to process. So naturally that must mean I’m just making these things in my head and lying to myself.

I know I’m bipolar. I just am scared I’m just lying to myself and everyone, what if I just want attention.

Oh well, fuck it we ball. Also I feel like my tone is kinda strange in writing this, I am realizing I’m writing this fairly numb. But not like a bad numb, just tired.

I don’t drink a lot of alcohol, and weekends are literally me resting to deal with the upcoming week. 

I have become concerned because until a couple of months ago my medication has been the same for ten years with a few dosage changes during Covid to deal with the stress. I spoke with my psychiatrist and after raising the dosage of one medication without results he added a third one. I have taken it before and every few weeks the dosage has been raised because I have become agitated and can’t “sit still”. I’m always up and down, feeling the need to be doing something. I’m starting to get the dreaded shakes and difficulty writing again at times and I really don’t want to continuously tell coworkers that I’m fine after they see me shake.

I know that I need to go back to therapy, but getting new therapists are exhausting because you have to retell your history, and they change positions a lot or leave medical groups.

I used to work as a pharmacy technician but that job ended up stressing me out and making me anxious about going into work on a daily basis. I was then jobless for a month before I decided to pick up what was planned to be a short term job working at a restaurant.

I ended up really enjoying the flexibility and lack of stress I was offered with said job, and while I’ve gotten a second one bartending that pays well, I know I can’t do this forever.

Oddly I am also on the spectrum but I was put in the role of someone responsible for her which was a huge problem during teens because I'd have to deal with my own shit and hers.

Problems ranged from talking about something someone close to me or said to me essentially I being a loudmouth.

bipolar,1anllzq,2024-02-10 23:04:22,"A couple years ago, I had a severe manic episode due to what was then an undiagnosed bipolar condition. It was so bad that I ended up getting in trouble with the law, twice. The first set of charges got expunged and I'm working on the second set. The whole situation had me uproot my life from VA back to NC where I'm from. When I quit my job as a Cybersecurity analyst, I started working a temp job in VA before I moved back to NC.

When I got to NC it took a couple months because I was still having the episode but I got a job at UPS. Did that for a couple of months, got another temp job packing bottles, now I'm working for a vending company. I did a couple interviews to try to get back into IT but I keep bombing them and it feels like I know nothing as a system administrator (which is what i was for a year before switching) or a Cybersecurity analyst which is one of the reasons why I quit, Imposter syndrome hit me hard. I was only in cyber for 2 years, the first year during COVID I was only working a tracking system so there wasn't much responsibility at first. 

I've been thinking about going to ECPI to get more comfortable but I have no clue what to say to any future employer/interviewer about why I quit, the gaps in my resume, why I left IT in the first place... it all looks and sounds very bad. 

I've thought about what to say for a long time and I can't come up with anything that sounds decent enough to get by. 

Sorry if my post is confusing, it was a confusing time and still doesn't make a lot of sense to me... what would you say if you were in my shoes?",couple years ago severe manic episode due undiagnosed bipolar condition bad ended getting trouble law twice first set charges got expunged working second set whole situation uproot life va back nc quit job cybersecurity analyst started working temp job va moved back nc got nc took couple months still episode got job ups couple months got another temp job packing bottles working vending company couple interviews try get back keep bombing feels like know nothing system administrator year switching cybersecurity analyst one reasons quit imposter syndrome hit hard cyber 2 years first year covid working tracking system much responsibility first thinking going ecpi get comfortable clue say future quit gaps resume left first place looks sounds bad thought say long time ca come anything sounds decent enough get sorry post confusing confusing time still make lot sense would say shoes
